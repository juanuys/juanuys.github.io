I made [taximeter](https://github.com/opyate/taximeter) as a spinoff of a technical test (passed; got the gig) for an Uber competitor in Israel.

I would like to use it with a visualisation: shows cabs on a live map, with live tariff updates as the cabs pick up and drop off customers over some amount of time.
