Week 6 was supposed to be a welcome break from the busy schedule to catch up on [my game](/tags#contumacious), but instead I filled my new-found time with more busywork:

- we're fixing up the house (instead of doing the planned renovation + extension over the summer) so we can sell and move closer to family
- we've had a few viewings already
- I [participated](https://opyate.itch.io/7drl-2021) in the [7DRL challenge](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2021)
- I've been hunting for more creative work, and might do a [bit of work](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26092636) with a friend

# Game jam

The game jam was a long time coming. I [set a goal last year](/masters/goals#be-a-better-designer) to do at least one game jam a month (or, at least make a small game every month), but I've only managed [Santa Saunter](https://juanuys.com/games/santasaunter) in December, completely coming up dry in January and February. (Maybe I had "[dry January](https://alcoholchange.org.uk/get-involved/campaigns/dry-january)" on my mind.)

[Football Crawl](/games/football-crawl) ended up with a really interesting game mechanic, which is that you can kick a football and it would move continuously in a traditionally turn-based Roguelike setting. I discovered a few new (to me) and really nice [Tilemap](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/using_tilemaps.html) features of [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/), like auto-tiling with bitmasking, and navigation (for NPCs).

# Creative work

The near-future creative work might involve a bit of Unreal Engine, but will mostly involve building a new streaming video pipeline, and I'll have to trawl the recesses of my mind and try and remember some of that C++ I did back at uni in 1998/99. I can't say more about it, but stay tuned. These are baby steps to my goal of becoming a full-time creative.
