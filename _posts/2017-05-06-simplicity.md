> Out of all virtues simplicity is my most favourite virtue. So much so that I tend to believe that simplicity can solve most of the problems, personal as well as the world problems . If the life approach is simple one need not lie so frequently, nor quarrel nor steal, nor envy, anger, abuse, kill. Everyone will have enough and plenty so need not hoard, speculate, gamble, hate. When character is beautiful, you are beautiful. That is the beauty of simplicity.
