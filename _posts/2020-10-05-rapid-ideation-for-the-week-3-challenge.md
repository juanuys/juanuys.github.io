The challenge for week 3 of development practice is

> ...identify an artefact you feel is particularly interesting.
> Select one or two of the prototyping methods outlined this week and build quick prototypal representations of your chosen artefact.

(TL;DR see [here](https://juanuys.com/slides/slides/disco-prelysium))

A quick run-down of the prototyping methods:

- Sketching
- Storyboarding
- Paper Prototyping
- Physical Modelling
- White / Grey Boxing
- Wireframes / Interactive Wireframing
- Game Prototyping
- Narrative Prototyping
- Wireflow (wireframes + flowcharts)
- Body-storming / Role-playing
- Wizard of Oz Testing

An artefact I've been particularly enamoured of lately is [Disco Elysium](https://zaumstudio.com/) [accessed 2020-10-05]. My favourite parts of the game are:

- the narratives and dialogue system
- the painterly pastel artwork
- the abilities and skills system

Typical of RPG systems is the player's indulgence in the meta game of min/maxing a player's attributes to fit their gameplay style. However, with Disco Elysium, this can have consequences:

> ...your focus of abilities and skills is probably the most important choice you can make in the entire game. The other thing to note is that <span class="highlight">while having any skill too low is obviously bad, upgrading any skill too high will also bring various negative effects</span> and character quirks.

The game's abilities and skills felt too daunting to "prototypally (prototypically?) represent", so I tried my hand at the narratives, and the game's layout and initial mockups. For narratives I used "Narrative Prototyping" and for the layouts and mockups I used "Wireframes" and "Sketching".

I present the prototypes using another medium that pops up a lot in these pre-production discussions: the presentation format. I had an extra bit of fun and gave the presentation a narrative feel... how very meta, I guess.

Have fun:
