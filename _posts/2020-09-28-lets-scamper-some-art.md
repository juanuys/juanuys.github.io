The challenge this week is to apply one of the ideation techniques we discussed to an existing artefact so as to remediate it into another artefact.

I'm a big fan of rolling the die on the creation process, so I'll be using this random image from randomdailyart.com:

![Bomen in de omgeving van Subiaco (trees in the Subiaco area) (1777–1847), Joseph August Knip](/assets/posts/2020-09-28-lets-scamper-some-art/trees/bomen.jpg)

> [Bomen in de omgeving van Subiaco (trees in the Subiaco area) (1777–1847), Joseph August Knip](https://randomdailyart.com/art/2020-09-25/)

The remediation will be with the help of randomised SCAMPER using [a tool I made](https://juanuys.com/scamper/).

Here are the modifications I stumbled upon:

# Modify

> Guiding question: What can I change in this way or that way so as to achieve such and such a result?

I had some freedom here to modify the picture in any way, so I made alternating negative strips.

# Rearrange (Or Reverse)

> What can I rearrange in some way – can I interchange components, the pattern, or the layout?

I then rearranged the strips.

# Eliminate

> Guiding question: What can I remove without altering its function?

I removed every other line to get a scanline effect.

There you have it. It might be interesting to script this process to randomise a whole bunch of these.

# Update

I wrote a [follow-up]({% post_url 2020-10-01-lets-scamper-some-art-part-ii %}) to this post.
