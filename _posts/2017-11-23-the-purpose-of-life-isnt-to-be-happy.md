**Idea:** Happiness, ​as ​associated ​with ​pleasure, ​isn’t ​enough ​and ​it ​fades. ​Struggle ​and ​pain
are ​necessary ​for ​a ​good ​life. ​Without ​them, ​we ​don’t ​grow, ​and ​we ​cease ​to ​evolve.

**Lesson:** The ​real ​purpose ​of ​life ​is ​to ​create ​a ​story ​in ​which ​you ​can ​constantly ​define ​what
it ​means ​to ​be ​better ​tomorrow ​than ​you ​are ​today. ​That’s ​what ​we ​are ​programmed ​for.
