This is week 2 of the module _indie game startup_, and let's jump right in.

By the end of this week, we will be able to:

- Estimate revenues of competitor games.
- Identify unmet market needs.
- Produce a Lean Canvas for a games business.
- Optimise a game’s sale price.

# Estimating revenues of competitor games

Estimating competitor revenue can be done to various degrees of accuracy depending on a few known variables. Also, my findings below only apply to Steam {% cite noauthor_steam_2003 -A %}, as I mainly develop PC games.

These numbers need to be taken with a grain of salt, as the market shifts every year. Also, consider or ask:
- who made the game? (did they have a large existing audience?)
- when did the game come out? (trends come and go)
- can you execute as well as they did? (what was their budget? marketing?)
- are players "monogamous" to this game in particular? (loyal) {% cite brace_yourself_games_how_2018 %}

## When week 1 sales is known

Jake Birkett utilises the Boxleitner method {% cite -A birkett_grey_2015 %}: year one sales is equal to three times the week one sales. So, if week one sold 10 shillings, then year one would sell 30 shillings. Keep in mind that the range is more like 2-10x, rather than just 3 {% cite birkett_you_2018 %}

Simon Carless agrees with a 2-5x range {% cite carless_steam_2020 -A %}.

Mike Rose recommends we look at number of players, not owners, as not necessarily everyone plays the games they buy {% cite gdc_lets_2018 %}.

A quote from a recent blog post on Steam expands the range a bit:

{% quote noauthor_steam_2020 %}
For reference, most recent games earning around $10,000 in the first two weeks earned between $20,000 and $60,000 over the course of 12 months following release. 
{% endquote %}

## Using reviews

Jake Birkett {% cite -A birkett_grey_2018 %} collected some data points from fellow indies, and plotted the review/sales ratios. The average from the entire dataset is 82x and the median is 77x, so if you see 10 reviews, expect ~800 sales (that's 10 * ~80, for the uninitiated).

## Using wishlists

Simon Carless reckons you get one sale for every 5 wishlists after polling and getting 50 datapoints from indie devs {% cite carless_steam_2020 -A %}.

# Identifying unmet market needs

Examples of identifying unmet needs in the gaming market:

- there have been no new games in a particular genre for 20 years. Will those folks buy a new game?
- a franchise is huge on console, but locked into that hardware. Can a new franchise with a similar aesthetic and gameplay compete on your platform?
- a genre is popular on PC but has never been brought to mobile, perhaps due to difficulties adapting the complex control scheme. Can you innovate on the controls?
- perhaps there's a theme that gamers have never seen before, or a genre mashup, like a monochrome dating shooter set underwater. Can you introduce something to players that they didn't know they liked?

Once you identify an under-served market, Eric Ries {% cite ries_lean_2019 -A %} says that to find product-market fit, you start by producing an MVP which serves their need. Prototype!

# Produce a Lean Canvas for a games business.

I present a WIP lean canvas for a game idea:

# Optimise a game’s sale price.

Wlad Marhulets {% cite marhulets_gamedev_2020 -A %} recommends the following:

- Price it fairly.
- If you think your game is low quality, don't rush to sell it at too low a price.
- Price high enough to still make profits at 75% discount.
- See what your competitors are selling at. Adjust accordingly if you offer better or less value.

You can always monetise the game again later with DLC, or if your game becomes popular, license it, or sell merchandise.

# Market analysis

I research two indie game case studies / postmortems. I show one business that performed well financially, and one with disappointing sales numbers.

TODO Also show the research I did around A Short Hike.
