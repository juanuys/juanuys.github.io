During week 11 of development practice, we touch a bit on workplace readiness, which I felt was valuable *even if* the point of doing the MA is to teach you more about starting up an indie studio (instead of finding a job in gamedev). I guess it's good to keep your options open, and you might need to do a bit of freelancing to tide you over when the studio goes through a dry patch.

A particular topic I want to reflect on is "personal brand". In the section "What employers look for in a CV", a recurring theme is "be yourself" and "be authentic", as collaborators want to work with real human beings {% cite noauthor_falmouth_nodate %}. This sentiment is also echoed by Michael R. Hunter, an expert on personal brand:

{% quote hunter_why_2017 %}
Today, authenticity is credibility. Gone are the days where credibility wears a suit and tie.

As a personal brand, authenticity is one of your biggest assets and strongest differentiating factors.
{% endquote %}

World-class marketer, Seth Godin, says this about authenticity:

{% quote godin_authenticity_2009 %}

Authenticity, for me, is doing what you promise, not "being who you are".

That's because 'being' is too amorphous and we are notoriously bad at judging that. Internal vision is always blurry. Doing, on the other hand, is an act that can be seen by all.

{% endquote %}

Seth's quote really hits home for me, because <span class="highlight">I want *Me* to be about *The Work That I Do*</span>.

I've been guilty of this in the past: endlessly tweaking my website, making the layout look right, the typeface neatly spaced, a good injection of colour to make it less dull, BUT not doing any real work. I might finally be in a place where I can focus on the work and rest assured the website is good enough.

In conclusion, the plan for the future stays the same as I've [mentioned before](/masters/goals), which is to keep on making, and sharing what I make, so I can keep on getting better at what I do.
