Myself and the cohort had a chance to meet one another and get a glimpse into each others' backgrounds. What struck us is the breadth and depth of skills the other students have. Some of us felt inferior and unprepared, or perhaps not worthy of being here.

I think I'm at risk of feeling overwhelmed, and wanting to go out and learn something about every facet of delivering a video game, e.g. 3D modelling, rigging, C++, so as to become a better generalist. Generalists seem to fare well in upper echelon management:

{% quote datta_upper-echelon_2014 %}
We find that 'strategic' CFOs with an elite MBA (generalist) consistently command a compensation premium, while 'accounting' CFOs (specialist) and CFOs with a non- MBA master's degree, even from an elite institution, do not.
{% endquote %}

I also have first-hand anecdotal evidence of this as a [full-stack web developer polyglot](https://uys.io/cv/), which interviewers and agents alike have called "rare". They have liked that I have seen many different systems and used many different tools, which greatly aids in my pattern matching capability.

Likewise, I also know that there's value in teams. "Indie" in "indie game development" stands for "independent", after all, not "individual". During this course we will learn about the business side of running an indie dev shop, and "Project managers do not need to be experts in what they are managing" {% cite newton_project_2009 %}.

So, it seems generalists do quite well. I will stop panicking, keep focusing on my core competencies, and:
- learn more about building a great team with complementary skills
- focus on building a great network of future collaborators
