Ever since [Ben Firshman](https://fir.sh/) introduced us to his [side project](http://www.fig.sh/) back in 2013 at the Land Registry, I've been hooked on Docker.

Also, since treating myself to a new HDD for Xmas and installing Arch Linux, I felt the need to keep concerns separate, almost like [AppImage](http://appimage.org/) promises to do. Docker to the rescue, naturally.

Here follows a non-exhaustive list of cool apps I've Dockerised or helped Dockerise.

## Unity3D

[opyate/unity3d](https://github.com/opyate/unity3d)

Thanks to [Thomas Shaw](https://github.com/tommyoshaw) for the head start. More fixes will come once I start Android/WebGL integration, but otherwise, I'm very excited to use it more. In fact, I told [someone](https://github.com/rosejn) for the first time today what my game idea is all about, and he nodded appreciatively. Note to self: enough [reading](http://tynansylvester.com/book/), and more coding!

## Android Studio

[tddpirate/androiddocker](https://github.com/tddpirate/androiddocker)

Thanks to [Omer Zak](https://github.com/tddpirate) for the head start. I discovered this repo two days after Omer made it public, and an email to-and-fro ensued, in which I suggested this and that. Apart from wiring the IoT, I think that being able to program the one thing you have with you all day is quite valuable.

## Github Leaderboard

[opyate/github-leaderboard-docker](https://github.com/opyate/github-leaderboard-docker)

Thanks to [Eugene Fidelin](https://github.com/eugef) for [Github Leaderboard](https://github.com/eugef/github-leaderboard)! It's Node/NPM, so I just had to contain(erise) this. (Be fhssre gur jengu bs n gubhfnaq yvggyr onqyl-ervairagrq jurryf yvggrevat lbhe uneq qevir...)

It turns out I had a good week.
