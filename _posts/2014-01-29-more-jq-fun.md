I've [written about](2013/11/05/my-new-favourite-way-to-pretty-print-json-in-vim.html) [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) before, but I mention it again here as a very useful tool for parsing JSON on the command line.

I needed to grab some England Bank holidays for a [quick hack](https://github.com/opyate/taximeter) the other day, and found that the GOV.UK team made web better by allowing you to append *.json* to any of their links to get to the data.
