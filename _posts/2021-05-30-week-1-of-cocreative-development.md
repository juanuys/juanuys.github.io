([devlog](/masters/gdd730/week1))

I've now started the 3rd module of the [masters](https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/study/online/postgraduate/indie-game-development), called **co-creative development**. We'll go deep on the concept of teamwork. TBH, I've always considered myself a bit of a loner, and always thought it would be cool to be one of those devs who made an entire hit game themselves (and the music!).

{% quote katzenbach_wisdom_2015 -l 88 %}
Rugged individualists -- and there are many, especially at the top -- cannot contribute to real team performance without taking responsibility for their peers and letting their peers assume responsibility for them. Yet they instinctively believe that "if you want a job done right, do it yourself." It is against their nature to rely on others for the really important tasks in life.
{% endquote %}

Could it make more sense to form a "working group", rather than a "team"? Perhaps some collective introspection can shed light on this. Katzenbach goes on to define "team" and espouses the virtues of a team being a sum greater than its parts:

{% quote katzenbach_wisdom_2015 -A -l 41 %}
A team is a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.
{% endquote %}

I'm looking forward to working with a subset of my own cohort and also the the [UX](https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/study/online/postgraduate/ux-design) cohort. We'll bring together a mix of technical and functional expertise, problem-solving and decision-making skills, and interpersonal skills.

And we'll have more fun than if we did it all by ourselves. Right? Right! {% cite katzenbach_wisdom_2015 -l 12 %}

# Spark forum

We're tasked with taking a personality test, e.g. at [Truity](https://www.truity.com/).  We've long known that the Meyers Briggs test is completely meaningless {% cite stromberg_why_2014 %}, {% cite pittenger_utility_1993 %}, so I opted for the Big 5 instead. I only found out afterwards that [it is also flawed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Critique) {% cite block_contrarian_1995 %}.

My result:

![OCEAN result](/assets/posts/2021-05-30-week-1-of-cocreative-development/big5-ocean-personality-test-results.png)

I interpret:

A high [Openness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience) (imagination, aesthetics, etc) score comes as no surprise - I'm doing the Indie Game Dev course, after all (which makes the high [Conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness) score useful, as I'll be organised and determined to finish it. Or, that's the aim, at least!). Low [Extraversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion) goes hand-in-hand with my desire for a simple, quiet life, and in fact: I can tinker away quietly for hours in my home office (as much as a life with wife and 2 kids allows; my friends come third, haha!). Average [Agreeableness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness) makes sense, as I tend balance my needs with those of others. I was surprised to see some [Neuroticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism), which is probably due to Covid, Brexit, having ageing parents, etc. I'll try and pay less attention to the news from now on.

# First chat with Josh

Josh and I threw some ideas around, and kind of circled back to doing something audio-related a couple of times (I spend way too much time staring at screens!). Josh was keen on starting with accessibility first this time around, and is something he has [reflected on before](https://skoobin.design/2021/04/04/uxd720-week-9-web-design/).

# Other

I've realised this week how organisational I really am. I created the team space on Microsoft Teams, then set up the first tech task list, and organised the first meeting with [Doodle](https://doodle.com/en/).
