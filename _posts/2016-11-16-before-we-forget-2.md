We [renovated our first home](/tag/pits-to-palace/) back in 2011/2012 and always meant to write that final blog post showing the finished result.

We bought it for £250K, spent about £100K on it (£80K of that accounted for) and [sold it](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-34967835.html) for £535K, so a profit just shy of £200K. It can be done, children!

Just in case the *rightmove* link above permanently expires, here are the final photos.

Oh, and before you scroll down, [here's a reminder](/2011/06/15/the-first-viewing-on-22nd-of-march-2011-as-you/) so you can ==see what a piece of crap this house was before we shook our respective magic wands at it==.

Adios, first house. It was nice living in you.
