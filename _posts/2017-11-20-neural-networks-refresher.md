I did [a course](http://issc.uj.ac.za/issc/scschool.html) in neural nets and cellular automata back in 2001. Behold my textbook:

I might have stated the reason for doing this course before, but in a nutshell: I was in my second year of electronic engineering at <acronym title="Rand Afrikaans Universiteit">RAU</acronym> (now <acronym title="Univertity of Johannesburg">UJ</acronym>) back in 1999, but dropped out because of personal reasons (hint: I didn't flunk). My applied math professor thought it a terrible waste to give up everything I've learned and suggested some of my credits go towards this diploma.

A few evenings later, and I could hand-code a [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) in C++..

The industry has changed a lot since then.

Not only is this a personal curiosity of mine, but I'm also using deep learning to build v2 of the algorithm which is powering [my startup](https://pdfcrun.ch/).

What follows is a list of resources I've assembled to pour over during the in-between moments:

- [Andrej Karpathy 's Stanford course](http://cs231n.github.io/)
- [Deep Learning Specialisation](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
- http://www.fast.ai/

There'll be a lot of overlap, and I'll be starting on Prof. Ng's course~~, so please [follow along](/tag/deeplearning/)~~.
