The game idea springs from my experiences with using public transport. Iâ€™ve been the victim of (and in some cases the perpetrator of) various infractions, large and small. Examples including playing elbow wrestling with your neighbour, farting, leaky earphones, and so forth.

This game will be inspired by the public transport commute, complete with stare-downs, elbow wrestles, and stinky food.

Stay chooned.
