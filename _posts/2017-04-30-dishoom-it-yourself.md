Dishoom makes a mean breakfast, and here's how you can do it yourself using a few things from the fridge and that naan you forgot about after last night's curry take-out.

* crisp a pack of bacon under the grill and render the fat right off
* slap the naan under the grill (mine was Peshwari) and warm it both sides
* scoop 2 large tablespoons of Branston Pickle into a ramekin
* add 10 or so shakes of Tabasco to the pickle, then mix
* open up the naan and spread some Philidelphia soft cream cheese
* layer the bacon and the pickle
* sprinkle some chopped coriander and black pepper over
* cover, fold and slice

I haven't taken a photo of my food since I paid money for Hipstamatic photo filters, but here you go:
