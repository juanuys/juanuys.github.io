During [week 2 we applied some of the ideation techniques]({% post_url 2020-09-28-lets-scamper-some-art %}) we discussed in the course.

We were encouraged to experiment with techniques we haven't with before (to learn about them; to get a feel for them), and what I noticed was some of us completely stumbled over a few of the techniques.

Case in point: SCAMPER {% cite michalko_thinkertoys_1991 %}. Some of us thought you literally had to apply **each** of the steps, and **in order**. This might or mightn't be the way this technique was intended to be used, but then I also discovered the Creative Thinkpak {% cite michalko_thinkpak_2006 %}, which encourages you to try a random SCAMPER until you have a breakthrough. I ended up building an online SCAMPER randomiser {% cite uys_randomised_2020 %} and then shared it with my cohort.

Much has been said about using the "right tool for the job" and "tools don't solve problems, people do" {% cite kastelle_tools_2011 %} but sometimes tools get in the way. We have to be mindful of this and apply a manner of meta-creativity in how we use our tools: either we use the tool differently, or use a different tool altogether.

Be agile. People over processes {% cite beck_agile_2015 %}. Put yourself ahead of your tools.
