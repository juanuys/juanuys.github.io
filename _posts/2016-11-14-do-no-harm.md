I've always wondered if there could be a simple mantra or commandment for humankind. Something simple which comes to mind each and every time you make a decision.

This pops up time and time again:

==Do no harm.==

Na√Øve, indeed.

I'm about to convey a worldview to my 3-year-old. Am I doing harm?

I'm about to execute on my party's new policy. Am I doing harm?

I'm about to publish this post. Am I doing harm?
