I [recently converted a new home office](/2016/10/17/my-new-home-office/) to keep my gadgets, tools and art out of reach of tiny little fingers. The remaining piece of furniture is a desk for drawing on.

IKEA sells a cheap adjustable desk called [LINNMON/FINNVARD](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/desks/table-tops-legs/linnmon-finnvard-table-white-spr-09001986/?k=090.019.86), and here I show how I modified the desk to adjust even higher.

## The mods

All those websites promising cut-to-size timber sounded promising, but the quotes are always bumped too high by shipping costs.

47 quid is a bit steep, so I saw [this](http://www.diy.com/departments/timber-smooth-t19mm-w89mm-l2400mm/249687_BQ.prd) at my local B&Q for a tenner.

In fact, when we got to B&Q, it was cheaper. I managed to pick up a plank and a 16mm drill bit for a £10.

The timber I bought was not exactly 20mm X 55mm, but the IKEA trestles offer some leeway, which I took advantage of.

## Final product

Here's the difference between the old adjusters and mine.

Also, due to the sloping floor in my garage, I go a notch lower on the left side to keep the table level.

There we have it: a nice spacious quasi- draughtsman's desk for £85.
