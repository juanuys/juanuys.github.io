This is not the ad I saw, but it was something like it:

Those who struggle financially probably don't own their homes, so are probably not allowed to sublet. If they do own their homes, they probably don't have enough money to make it nice for strangers to rent.

The message is this: if you're a wealthy Camden homeowner, we can help you sublet to earn extra cash with which to purchase useless crap that you don't need to fill the other unused rooms in your large house.
