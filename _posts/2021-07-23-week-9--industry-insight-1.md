In the week 9 spark forum, we're asked to imagine starting up as a team. Here's my individual answer (not my team's):

> Firstly, if we ever changed our name from The Falmouth Foulmouths, it would have to be "Juan, Luis & Partners" (credit: Josh, and a [wat?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis_%26_Partners) link for our non-UK friends). We haven't discussed working together in the future as a team, although our Team Charter makes provisions for taking the idea further after this module is over (either as a team, or individuals, and things start getting litigious at this point). 
>
> Even though we're only focusing on making a narrative-branching audio-first game, Luis had the insight to create a platform for distribution and where other authors can easily make similar products. So, I can imagine starting *that* with the guys, and taking it further. I would probably refer to myself as "CTO", although I'm more likely to end up an [individual contributor](https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-term-Individual-Contributor-Role-the-HR-guys-in-IT-industry-came-up-with-these-days). ("Many stellar developers are interested in only coding and not interested in people management roles." - their words, not mine ðŸ˜€) We'll be as remote as possible, and on a 4-hour-workweek because we're all Tim Ferriss fanbois (I'm guessing), with communication being entirely via end-to-end encrypted smoke signals (read as: work-life balance, and not an interruption-driven culture).
>
> The "& Partners" in our name is exactly what it says on the tin: we'll be a [worker collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative#Worker_collectives). (This is an idea I've thrown around on our Discord, as too much money goes to the top nowadays.)
>
> CYOA is trademarked by ChooseCo, so I'll slogan will have to be "Choose Your Own Misadventure", with lots of Grimm/horror themes. Logo? I'll let Maciej worry about that one.
>
> How to find success: make good stories. Neil Gaiman is a super nice chap, so it might be worth trying to approach him to get some celebrity cred. Have really good sound design, binaural audio, plenty of [ASMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASMR) vibes. Promote eye health, as you're not necessarily staring at your device for this one - you can "play" with your eyes closed.

A few things to take note of:

# Individual contributor

I really do think I'm more likely to do gamedev on my own, and collaborate every now and then with other one-person-indies (i.e. self-starters who knows how to get things done). I like to collaborate with folks in short bursts, and don't want to be saddled with a company, and be responsible for people's salaries, or their motivation.

# Worker collective

As much as I dislike seeing so much wealth rise to the top on a daily basis, perhaps starting a collective will be quite hard indeed. Or it won't happen easily. I think relationships that end up in partnerships like these take a lot of time, so perhaps the collective will gestate.

# Work-life balance

I've [quoted]({% post_url 2020-10-21-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow%}) Roald Dahl before. Go to [his website]
(https://www.roalddahl.com/create-and-learn/write/roald-dahl-on-writing) and skip to the section labelled "What is your work routine?" (or, listen to it [here](https://youtu.be/99Q8MaoNvTM))
He only writes for 2 hours a day. But, it is deep, focused work.

I think this is all human beings are capable of. Anyone who sits in an office for 8 or 9 hours a day are fooling themselves and their micro-managing middle-managers. You do 2 hours of focused work, if you're lucky, and the rest of the time is spent on water cooler chatter, meetings, reading the news, going for a long poo so your can swipe through your phone in peace, etc. I'd rather just spend the 2 hours working, and spend the other 6 hours on my own terms.


# Not an interruption-driven culture

# As remote as possible

I like to be in quiet surroundings, and on my own, when working.

# Tips from the industry

## Spry Fox

https://flex.falmouth.ac.uk/courses/913/pages/week-9-spry-fox-innovate-in-your-pants?module_item_id=54740

Lots of good tips, but here are the ones specifically about remote teamwork:

- Keep prototypes so small that you only need max 2 people on it initially (e.g. designer + programmer, or a lone technical designer)
- No paper prototypes (as the team is remote, digital prototypes work better)
- timezones can be a PITA, but you can hire the best people
- chemistry can be difficult to achieve over video chat

# Week development log

## 2021-07-25 Sunday

Started preparing for the 3 minute demo video for the final submission:
- have all art downloaded and in Dropbox
- have all SFX downloaded and in Dropbox
- have all ambient sound (forest + footsteps) downloaded and in Dropbox
- all imported into a new iMovie project
- started a doc on Google Docs detailing the plan for the video
