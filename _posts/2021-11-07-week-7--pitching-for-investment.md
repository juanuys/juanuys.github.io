Welcome to week 7 of the module _indie game startup_.

# A quick reflection

This reflection ties in a little bit with pitching, in that your pitch has to show that the game you're making has its finger on the market pulse.

I've been thinking about the word *zeigeist*:

{% quote noauthor_oxford_nodate %}
the defining spirit or mood of a particular period of history as shown by the ideas and beliefs of the time.
{% endquote %}

It's up to game designers to figure out what the future zeitgeist in gaming is going to be.

Before we get to the future zeitgeist, what is the current zeitgeist? Cosy games, perhaps?

We've all been affected adversely by the pandemic, but cosy games were our balm:

{% quote grossman_cozy_2021 %}
Cozy games balmed the anxiety, isolation, and feelings of instability induced by the pandemic.
{% endquote %}

I've also spotted a few subgenres with the *cozy* genre: deep games which lets you deal with death and loss thoughtfull like [Spiritfarer](https://thunderlotusgames.com/spiritfarer/) {% cite noauthor_spiritfarer_nodate %} or [Cozy Grove](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458100/Cozy_Grove/) {% cite noauthor_cozy_nodate %}, and photo-taking games like [Alba](https://www.albawildlife.com/) {% cite noauthor_alba_nodate %} and [TOEM](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307580/TOEM/) {% cite noauthor_toem_nodate %}.

But what about the future? How do you predict the future zeitgeist? I suppose it's tricky to tell the future, so perhaps it's easier to wait for the next big event to happen (like the pandemic) and then trying to think how that event will affect the populace, especially the gaming populace.

COP26 is currently in session {% cite noauthor_climate_nodate %}, and many experts are claiming that major change has to happen right now, if we're going to let global warming stall at 1.5 degrees Celcius {% cite millard_15_2021 %}.

So, might concern for the environment be a zeitgeist for games? And what would that look like? Climate change isn't new, but there's renewed urgency.

Games dealing with climate change [exist](/assets/posts/2021-11-07-week-7--pitching-for-investment/WUandLEEnclimate2566.pdf) {% cite wu_climate_2015 %}. There are also a multitude of games which deal with a post-apocalyptic future with different causes, like the aftermath of nuclear fall-out (like in Fallout), or volcanic winter (like in Frostpunk {% cite noauthor_frostpunk_nodate %}), but I'm mostly thinking of greenhouse gases as the cause.

Or, perhaps the next shift in gaming is making games more energy efficient? GPUs consume many watts of power, and games are already being scrutinised in this regard {% cite conocimiento_video_2020 %}. This isn't helped by the fact that players would leave their games running (without playing) just to collect trading cards that reward long play times {% cite noauthor_can_nodate %}. (Perhaps us gamedevs can pay attention to detecting idle behaviour, then returning early in the main loop, or exiting the game?)

There's a lot more to explore around climate change awareness in gaming, and much more to explore around what the next zeitgeist can be.
