2 weeks is not enough paternity leave for any new father, so I embarked on a 10 month adventure as a WFH dad / freelancer.

I mostly worked with start-ups from my network, and work included credit scoring, news generation by way of AI, a service marketplace, and solving the age-old British problem of the queue.

A few months into freelancing I also started chiseling away at a side-project called [pdfcrunch](https://pdfcrun.ch).

I also incorporated as [Unleash Your Server](https://www.uys.io) (as one does!).

## Unleash Your Server

From server to app in 60 (to the power of 3.7 &#8432;) seconds.

<em>*</em> custom development, estimate for typical consumer app. One day we will auto-generate these things.

Over the years I've amassed and honed a bunch of skills that empowers me to take one or many bare-bones servers (e.g. EC2/app-cell/dyno) and turn it into an application comprised many moving parts and components, including messages queues, databases, web servers, caches, web APIs, responsive and easy-to-use frontends, and mobile clients &mdash; all backed by an agile development process and other pragmatic best practices, including full configuration management, continuous integration, source control, and a whole host of other things I consider obvious and take for granted. Full-stack developer? Maybe!

I've always wanted to form a collective of capable and varied individuals to build beautiful things with me, because I believe teams are better than individuals. I have, however, failed to do so twice now, mostly due to shifting interests, or loosing team members to itches they just have to scratch.

Unleash Your Server is a new endeavour, but I've started this one on my own. The name is a play on my surname, UYS, chosen by my mate and old business partner [@wehtam](http://twitter.com/wehtam) (yes, I suck at naming things, and besides &mdash; it's one of the two biggest problems in computer science, alongside cache invalidation, and off-by-one errors).

Apart from finding new problems to solve and organically building businesses around them, I've had the immense privilege of starting my new journey with GOV.UK on the [transformation](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/01/29/200-days-of-transformation-200-days-to-go/) project.

## pdfcrun.ch

[pdfcrunch](https://pdfcrun.ch) turns PDFs into data. It's been quite computer vision -heavy, and I've been spending a lot of time in iPython notebooks tweaking algorithms.

The tech stack comprises Python (with scikit/numpy/etc for the CV stuff, and Tornado/Flask/Pika for the API glue), Scala and Clojure (to interface with some existing Java-based PDF tools), Docker (running a cluster on EC2 using tutum.co), PostgresQL, RabbitMQ (to de-couple the many different types of background workers), with AngularJS on the frontend (for editing stencils).

Recent developments in deep learning means I have a whole bunch of new toys to play with, and as yet a perfectly accurate model evades me.

## Other

I do some speaking and teaching on APIs at [The Mobile Academy](http://themobileacademy.org.uk/whos-who/juan-uys/). You'll sometimes see me at the Scala, Ruby and various other meetup groups.

## Learning

## Doodling

I've recently taken up doodling, and like most people who dive into a new hobby, you initially think you're quite good (Dunningâ€“Kruger!) and that's when you get picture book ideas and comic book ideas and think you can publish something one day. I'm now past that stage and think I suck quite a bit, but it's fun nonetheless and it might cheer someone up to see them.
