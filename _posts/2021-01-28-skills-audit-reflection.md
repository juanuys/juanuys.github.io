What follows is a reflection on my [skills audit]({% post_url 2021-01-28-skills-audit %}).

# Roles in the game industry

I re-iterate the seven game-development skills in the industry here:

- Game design
- Programming
- Narrative design
- Art
- Animation
- Level design
- Sound design

I indicate my focuses for this module using a ❤, so the skills I'm most excited to learn are **art** and **game design** (and **narrative design** - see below):

This is what I answered on the uni forum:

> Game design, and art. I'm not sure if animation will come in at all in the types of games I want to make. Level design for me so far has mostly boiled down to procedurally generating a puzzle layouts. Sounds I download from freesound.org and perhaps a tiny bit of mastering to get it to the same level. Narrative, nil so far, and possibly nil in the future.

Nil? I was tired when I wrote that.

Thinking about it a bit more, I am actually also quite interested in boosting my **narrative design** skills. I love writing short stories, and have a wacky imagination, so I feel I might spend some time in this area too.

{% quote lionbridge_narrative_2020 %}
In the game development process, narrative game design defines the game’s story structure and core emotional elements including theme, plot, character, and dialogue.
{% endquote %}

I did have a blast learning more about it in a [previous course](/tags#narrative-design).

# Conclusion

I dismissed narrative design in a moment of weakness, but I have a growth mindset {% cite stanford_alumni_developing_2014 %} and will embrace everything (within limits).

I will create a mood board with inspiration and ideas for this semester's game, as I tend to get distracted by new and shiny things when on the web. I have to find that feeling I feel when seeing my inspiration, and try to recreate that same feeling in the player when they play the game.

Oh, how I wish I had the luxury of time to just read the Art of Game Design cover to cover {% cite schell_art_2019 %}.

Also, I was reminded of the personal branding discussion from the previous module, and I decided this is something which will flesh out more as I really nail down what types of games I'll be making.
