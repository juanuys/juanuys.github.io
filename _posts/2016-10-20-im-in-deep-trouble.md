I'm a contractor programmer. I'm also an artist at heart. 

I fed the programmer but starved the artist.

Here's a tab I have open in my browser right now:

==My first Angular 2 app.==

Some client wants me to implement their app-that-doesn't-really-matter using the new hotness.

&lt;lots of redacted content, akin to a small dirty bomb going off right here in your web browser&gt;

Let's just say in the friendliest words possible that I can't be bothered to learn a new JavaScript *thing*.

Instead, I'm trying to find a way out of this mess so I can do more doodling. Without starving my family.

My brain is kicking its heels in. Like I said: deep trouble.
