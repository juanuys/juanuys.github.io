I keep thinking back to my startup days, and endlessly agonising over the pitch deck. It had to be max 10 slides, contain lots of graphics and almost no words (you don't want your audience to read - you want them to listen), and you want to grab their attention for 5 minutes. No dawdling, no droning on.

We'd start off with established knowledge of slide decks (citations evade me now, as I can't remember the specific websites we perused back in 2010-2012), and then fine-tune based on live data, from delivering the pitches at e.g. the [Dublin Web Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Summit), or at our incubator [Wayra](https://www.wayra.uk/), the latter at which we'd get one-on-one coaching from our mentors (again, not very cite-able).

That said, Josh is taking the lead on the pitch, and I'm happy to be around to assist.
