I keep thinking back to my startup days, and endlessly agonising over the pitch deck. It had to be max 10 slides {% cite kawasaki_only_2015 %}, contain lots of graphics and almost no words (you don't want your audience to read - you want them to listen), and you want to grab their attention for 5 minutes. No dawdling, no droning on.

We'd start off with established knowledge of slide decks (citations evade me now, as I can't remember the specific websites we perused back in 2010-2012), and then fine-tune based on live data, from delivering the pitches at e.g. the [Dublin Web Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Summit) {% cite noauthor_web_2021 %}, or at our incubator [Wayra](https://www.wayra.uk/) {% cite noauthor_wayra_nodate %}, the latter at which we'd get one-on-one coaching from our mentors (again, not very cite-able).

That said, Josh is taking the lead on the pitch, and I'm happy to be around to assist.

# Pitching in the Covid era

We'll be pitching to a panel of experts via video chat, but we also have the option of pre-recording our pitches. I think we're currently preferring a live pitch, but we'll see what happens when we get to week 6.

Meanwhile, I've been looking into digital pitches, and what the upsides and downsides of a pre-recorded pitch is.

All the below are taken from the [UK Business Angels Association](https://ukbaa.org.uk/digitise-your-pitch-events-tips-and-advice-for-how-to-move-online-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/) {% cite noauthor_digitise_2020 %}, plus a few of my own ideas.

- live pitches can fall victim to "demo bugs", i.e. screen-sharing doesn't work, or you hook up the wrong audio source, or your Internet connection dies
- likewise, pre-recording pitches can alleviate the pressure that pitching via an online platform can have.
- pitching live gives the founder their moment to shine, whereas pre-recording could make it less engaging. (This can be alleviated by doing polls in the pre-recorded pitch, e.g. asking for a raise of hands for a certain question)
- currently, *smaller* investments are happening as a result of digital pitching events and investors prefer to see founders face-to-face before committing funds
- pre-recorded pitches are something you can re-use, and potentially refine based on feedback
- conversely, live pitches have the benefit of the presenter being able to "read the room" and adapting on the fly
- pre-recorded pitches can benefit from more dynamic content. It's a video, after all! This will make it more engaging
