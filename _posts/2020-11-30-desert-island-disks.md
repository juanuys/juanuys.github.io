Fellow student Will wrote a post called [desert island disks](https://wil1333.wixsite.com/mysite/post/desert-island-disks), and asked for ours. Here goes.


# 5. Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss

[The Stygian Abyss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Underworld:_The_Stygian_Abyss) was my favourite game as I entered my teenage years. I would think about the game whilst at school, drawing underground worlds in my notebook until the closing bell. Then I'd rush home, but having a feeling of dread at the thought of going into the scary dungeons yet again.

It was the first first-person 3D game I ever played. Even playing Wolfenstein 3D afterwards didn't live up to it, even if released 2 months after - Wolf 3D's gameplay and viewpoint was limited to a single plane, I guess to make the game faster, whereas you could look up and down in Abyss.

There were 8 very large underground levels to explore, but I remember it feeling like 50.

It's infinitely replayable, as you can create different characters and find a different way through the dungeons every time.

# 4. Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design

Not only did I and my late father play a lot of *actual* golf when I was young, but we played a lot of [Jack Nicklaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus%27_Unlimited_Golf_%26_Course_Design) too. 

Everything about the game was great - the long manual which taught you how to design courses, the beautifully colourful and embossed box, and of course the game itself. Having more time than my dad, I would make him a new course once in a while.

I have to add, though - my favourite memories of my dad is not playing the video game together, but finishing the 18th hole every Saturday just to kick back at the club house with a basket of fries and a basket of chillies, him with a beer, and me with a not beer.

# 3. Diablo II

[Diablo II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_II) hit me during my uni years, which means my grades weren't as good as they ought to have been. I used to hear the haunting game music in my head whilst in the lecture hall, or studying at my desk. I guess the same way I used to see Tetris when I closed my eyes many years earlier as a SNES fanboy.

Again, infinite replayability, as you can create different characters with different traits, and the wilderness and dungeons are generated. It reminded me so much of [Pagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_VIII:_Pagan) which I played endlessly a few years before, but it was so much better.

# 2. Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2

[Dune II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II) was easy to beat - you just had to build a path all the way to your enemy base, and they'd attack the path instead of you, while you flanked them. [Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_(video_game)) was punk-rock fun, which suited rebellious teenage me perfectly, but it lacked resource management.

I guess that's why I love [Red Alert II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert_2) so much. It's perfectly balanced, and the cut-scenes were hilariously hammy. 

For a brief time after uni, I was a struggling musician, living in a house with my bandmates and some of our actor friends. (In retrospect, how did we all ever manage rent!?). In-between gigs, band practice, or writing songs with [Cakewalk Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cakewalk_(sequencer)), life was made of Red Alert II. Happy days.

# 1. Deus Ex

OK, [now here's a game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game)) I've played a few times already, and nothing comes close. The mood is undeniably oppressive cyber dystopian future - I was getting through a lot of William Gibson at the time, so the game gave me an outlet to exist in a similar world. I have a bit of an obsession with "cyber dystopia" games, [Syndicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicate_(1993_video_game)) being a favourite from a few years earlier.

I even pretended to be a hacker once and attended the Johannesburg chapter of the [2600](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2600:_The_Hacker_Quarterly) meetups (I did again a few years later in London, and made some good friends). But, I have to say, it was more fun being JC Denton than sitting in a mall cafeteria with a bunch of shade-wearing dudes (they might get "recognised").

You could bomb and blast your way through a game, and try it as a lock-picking stealthmeister in your next run. You can mod weapons, you can mod yourself. NPC interactions really meant something. The world felt alive.

# Conclusion

Similarly to Will, my list has very good replay value. There are other favourites, like [Half-Life 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2), [StarCraft II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty) (I see a sequel pattern emerging...), [Disco Elysium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Elysium)... But the games in the list above were formative in a sense, and gave me my fondest memories.
