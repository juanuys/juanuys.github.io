I made a [Steam Revenue Calculator Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/steam-revenue-calculator/). It is a port (with permission of the original author) of the [Chrome Extension of the same name](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/steam-revenue-calculator/gjhejidajnchnadcangcodljgdmenipa).


The [source code is here](https://github.com/opyate/steam-revenue-calculator-firefox-extension).

If the numbers look off, please let me know. The Boxleiter/formulas do change from time to time to stay up-to-date with latest market behaviour.
