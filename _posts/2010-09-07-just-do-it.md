Developers, like any other human being, are constantly daydreaming about making it big. Be it the next Hot App or Google-killer. *Small and focused* gets us there most of the way. *Large and daunting* is an invitation to distractions and procrastination.

While this article doesn’t aim to discuss time management, efficiency and productivity, I’ll try to write the story of my own life as a *developer with a few ideas*. This journey started in the mid-nineties during the birth of the World Wide Web.

# We’ve all been there.

So, here you are again in front of your computer. Over the years you’ve trained and worked hard to be the developer you are today. You’ve also seen countless tech companies rise and shape the Web as we know it.

You sat in front of your 486 in 1996 looking with wide-eyed wonder at this Thing called the World Wide Web, with its animated GIFs and stale content. The former was later replaced by JavaScript, CSS and Video. The latter with dynamic content. Content was given context. You can *share with a friend* and up-vote.

Things got better, but you had a few ideas of your own. Some nights you sit behind a browser and endlessly browse geek and tech websites for inspiration. Some nights you write a bit of code. You put your code out there for the world to see. Usually it’s not *production ready* and almost always you’re not solving someone’s problem.

Then life goes on and you read about the trials and tribulations of the likes of [DHH](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=0CDXJ6bMkMY#t=1236 "Often the simplest ideas in the world, like treating your customers nicely while still asking for money for what you do... CAN WORK!") and Mark Zuckerberg. You start researching SEO, marketing, outsourcing. You’re suddenly in a world you’re not used to. Opinions vary and advice is scattered in an incongruous mess all over.

You think about doing an MBA or a marketing course. Some are even brave enough to contact a few key players and find a muse in the process. Some nights ends in endless research. You read [Tim Ferris’ book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357), but then you stumble upon [Rob Walling’s book](http://www.startupbook.net/) and wonder *perhaps I should read this too, because it sounds like Tim’s book, but more relevant to developers*.

And so it goes on. Your time is sucked into gaining the knowledge, but not applying it.

# You can do it!

You have gained enough knowledge. Seriously. I’ll practice what I preach and start a venture today. I am going to make mistakes. My choices won’t necessarily be correct or educated. But, I’m going to give it a shot.

Please follow my journey ~~(all posts will be [tagged with startup](/tag/startup))~~. I’ll try to write a little bit about what I’ve done every day, aptly numbered. Wish me luck.
