Xmas post:

todo xmas card

I used to be a ferocious reader, and I used to think I'd get to read most of the classics, at least one new sci-fi per year, and perhaps a few more new best-sellers. However, at my current pace, it looks like I need to make a list of 300 books to read, and that will be that.
