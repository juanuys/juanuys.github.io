Week 5 is all about art direction, and we're tasked with developing an art direction document.

The art direction doc is a [living document](https://github.com/juanuys/ccgdd/blob/master/art-direction.md), but I will reflect on the *current-at-the-time-of-writing-this* version (Git commit hash `e421c18`) of the document here:

# Intro

This week was hard. So many lecture videos, which crammed SOOO many concepts into my head. That, paired with the fact that art direction is an iterative process {% cite noauthor_week_nodate %}, which meant that every day I had to remember the tens of tiny tools and tricks whenever I iterated on a design.

I'm glad next week is reading week, and I might steal some time from animation (week 7) and level design (week 8) to finish this off, as those two themes are also circumscribed by the art direction.

That all said, I feel like going to art school.

# Reflection: Research the target market. Really?

{% quote noauthor_week_nodate %}

We should make art direction decisions based on observation of the real world and knowledge of art history, as well as research into the target market for our game, its potential audience and its competitor products.

{% endquote %}

I'm not sure I agree fully. If you asked people what they wanted, you'd end up making something bland (as people say stuff to please you) or something which is popular right now (and not 2 years down the line when you finally release).

Henry Ford; faster horses.

But on the flipside, perhaps there is something about being an indie which I don't grok yet. Perhaps it's not about working on what you want. Perhaps it is not about making art that comes from the art. Perhaps it is about your studio being a finely tuned machine that can deliver games like a production line. 

If my studio was a band, maybe it shouldn't try to sound like The Mars Volta or Tool, but rather Taylor Swift or Beyonce.

# Reflection: four Fs

Lee Petty's [Four Fs](https://youtu.be/NwXThTYbZY4?t=1587) {% cite mediaxstanford_elements_2017 %} was very helpful in nailing down some concepts early on. Otherwise, I do feel like art is very subjective. Sure, you learn about techniques and theory (colour, etc), but at the end of the day, what you come up with isn't Right or Wrong. Not everyone will like your style, but some might, and that's who matters to you.
