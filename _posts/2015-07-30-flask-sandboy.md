I made a fork of [Flask-Sandboy](https://github.com/UYSio/flask_sandboy) to aid in rapid proto-typing at the [GDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Digital_Service).

Simply create your database tables, then have a RESTful API on it in minutes.

Yes, I know there's Django and a million other little frameworks with which to do the same, but we're pretty much a Flask shop over here, and prefer to include our own batteries.
