During week 10 of GDD730, we look at some more industry insights.

Last week was a little bit busy again personally towards the end, as we packed, and moved again on Saturday (this time from the temporary flat in London, to a temporary AirBNB in lovely Stroud).

TODO blog post about Bandersnatch being removed from Netflix due to a ChooseCo lawsuit.
TODO talk about collectives again. Phoebe Herring talking about freelancing and getting shafted, or moving off the platforms (like Upwork) so freelancers can get a bigger cut. The game industry is huge - why can't everyone share in the pie? A local/UK-based collective can be "best of Britain", locally-sourced talent, who are paid good rates, and everyone is happy. It doesn't always need to be a race to the bottom. Being a socialist "starts at home". No-one is going to vote Jeremy Corbyn to be PM any time soon, but we can start at the grassroots level and let equality "start at home", so to speak.




# Weekly development log

# 2021-08-01 Sunday

Worked some more on the "3 minute demo video". iMovie doesn't label the imports, so it's a slow-ish process of playing a bit of every imported clip to know what it relates to, before dragging it into the edit area.

# 2021-03-02 Monday

We had the supervisor catch-up tonight again with Matty, and I did nothing else. (Had the kids all day, as my partner was away.)

# 2021-08-03 Tuesday

We had a planning meeting tonight, and went over the pitch deck, and highlighted anything that needed to be done or added. Josh took notes, and will then create tasks in our Pivotal, then assign accordingly.

I spent the rest of the evening catching up on week 10 content, and doing some blogging.
