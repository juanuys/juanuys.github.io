Meditation app sends punter into [a state of panic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getsomeheadspace.android&reviewId=Z3A6QU9xcFRPRmZVSS1SaktfY3pPQ2xlcWEwSGQtQW5OZFYtcl8xSE81bURzSThTZXVDbXc0WWJweTZqbTY1d0hIdTU2dkVydlExUHZ4R1pkTm1xWWszM0M4&hl=en_GB).

> Help!!!! Still not OK!!!! This app is amazing so I went for the subscription. I accidentally clicked year instead of month and now I'm going to be £85 down with my rent due. I can't seem to get any responses (ref 247029) about this and <span class="highlight">I'm desperate!</span> I just want my account to be switched from yearly to monthly as this app has helped massively in recent weeks. I afford that much in one go! \*update* I had an email back and I responded as requested and now nothing again! Guys rent is due the 10th and <span class="highlight">I'm panicking!!!</span>
