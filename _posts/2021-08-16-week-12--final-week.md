# Did my team like the project?

folks being in love with a different idea of what the game would be like.
That's why I made it clear in the very beginning what the game is going to be.

# As team-work worth it in the end?

p 468
Game design and development are hard. Unless you are multitalented and your project is tiny, you can't do it alone. People are more important than ideas, because, in the words of Pixar's Ed Catmull, "If you give a good idea to a mediocre group, they'll screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a good group, they'll fix it."


# Did everyone have fun?

game filtered through a large number of people would be anything other than bland. As it turned out, the opposite was true; the people involved were tired of working in isolation and were energized by the collaborative process, and the resulting designs had a consistent level of polish and depth that hadn’t been seen before. 

p4

People with strong personalities, people with poor verbal skills, or people who just don’t like creating in a group setting shouldn’t be forced into it. We weighted our groups heavily toward people with a lot of group design experience, well ahead of game design experience.


# My next steps

Be myself. You are your happiness. Bhagavad Gita (Hindu text): a person who is happy has achieved the self. In other words, authetically being yourself brings joy.




# Weekly development log

## 2021-08-16 Monday

Worked some more on cutting the 3-minute demo video tonight.
Published [draft #3](https://youtu.be/1ITDmPWtRkQ) of our 3-minute demo video. I do sincerely hope this will be the final draft, as this is submission week, and I don't want to be working on this in the few days leading up to D-Day.
