I'm finding myself in a precarious situation: I've spent a considerable amount of my free time over the past few years on a project, and the raison d'Ãªtre for its existence still evades me. In other words, **I can not crack the core algorithm which will put it ahead of the competitors**.

So, I sit there. Wondering what to do. Not quite able to do anything else. Hands tied. Sunbathing in the LED backlight.

# What do I work on next?

Certainly not another big project. I'm stuck on an existing big project, and I don't want to burn out.

For a couple of days I just frittered away the time.

Then it dawned on me: my online CV is quite dreary. It mentions things like doing stuffy Java things for dusty old banks and government agencies. My online professional presence has no pictures, no *"new shiny"*, nothing to excite anyone looking at it.

> I need a portfolio website.

It makes perfect sense. Besides, for a while now I've had the urge to rebrand myself as a creative developer. (I thought this would be the closest I'd get to games dev without starving my family).

Here's my existing text-only professional website:

What you'll see over the next few weeks at [https://uys.io](https://uys.io) is a website which showcases the real me, and all the bits and pieces I've worked on over the years: failed startups, side projects, and the little hacks still worth showing to the world. Some will be shown as is, and some will get a little bit of spit and polish to breathe new life in what would overwise just be a code repo on Github.

# Conclusion

I recommend this for any developer stuck in a debilitating funk. Work on the little things you're proud of. Show the world. You'll deliver early and often, feel good about it, and gear up for the next big challenge &mdash; be it a more fun client to work with (because they've seen your AWESOME portfolio), or your next big startup idea.
