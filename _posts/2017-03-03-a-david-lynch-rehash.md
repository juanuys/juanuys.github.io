I thought that perhaps this could be an easy mechanism for Lazy Me to pollute the Internet with more of the empty little nothings that pop into my head every now and then.

For starters, I'll practice with Herr Lynch's idea by copying his template with empty speech bubbles.

Then I'll hook this [Blitline](https://www.blitline.com/) script up to [Zapier](https://zapier.com) so I can email my snippets of dialogue to a personalised Cartoon Bot.
