# Week development log

## 2021-07-05 Monday

We had the team supervisor catch-up, and I'm happy to be acknowledged for keeping the project on track by playing devil's advocate on new feature suggestions. This stems from acquiring many battle scars in the early years of my career, seeing projects overrun, or get shut down because of spiraling costs. I've been lucky lately to be in more mature teams who know how to say No, and focus on the essentials. I am myself a big fan of essentialism, having devoured McKeown's book {% cite -A mckeown_essentialism_2014 %}.
