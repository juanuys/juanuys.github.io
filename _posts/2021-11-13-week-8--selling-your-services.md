# A quick reflection about working in gamedev as a freelancer

I think the best thing for me to do is transition from my current career in webdev to being full time indie in a phased way, i.e. spending one day a week making games, then 2 days a week, etc, until my old career is phased out.

I have actually done some job hunting in the gamedev space in the last few years, and reached out to perhaps 20 or so studios, and NONE of them wanted a freelancer or contractor with my skills. They all wanted permies.

That said, I should rather look at job sites where they advertise temporary work explicitly, and apply there. But do I want to? Perhaps not - I think I'd rather focus on my own future studio for the time being.

So, yes - my best bet is to just have a go at it myself, as I'm not interested at this stage to get a full-time job in gamedev. In any case, why would I spend 2 years doing an *indie* gamedev masters, only to become non-indie.

(Note to self: look around for freelance work anyway, just to keep some options open.)

# A quick reflection about making web-based games

I've been pottering around a lot in Godot lately, but also played a bit of [Fallen London](https://www.fallenlondon.com) and wondered if I'm in a good position to make a web-based game.

The webdev skills are there, and one of my bigger ideas have been mulling around in my head since 2006/2007, so perhaps it's a good idea to get something going, which I can contribute to every now and then. Grow the world; grow the story; think about monetisation later.
