During week 3 of development practice we discuss ideation and prototyping, and I'm briefly reminded of [ICEDIP](https://flex.falmouth.ac.uk/courses/872/pages/week-2-what-is-creativity?module_item_id=44797) in the previous week:

> [Inspiration](http://geoffpetty.com/creativity/inspiration/) – <span class="highlight">research</span>, brainstorm, and generate ideas
> 
> [Clarification](http://geoffpetty.com/creativity/clarification/) – define and focus on goals
> 
> [Evaluation](http://geoffpetty.com/creativity/evaluation/) – pros and cons, strengths and weaknesses of concept, review your work and learn from it
> 
> [Distillation](http://geoffpetty.com/creativity/distillation/) – decide what you want to leave in or out
> 
> [Incubation](http://geoffpetty.com/creativity/incubation/) – give the idea some time, sleep on it (folks tend to rush this bit)
> 
> [Perspiration](http://geoffpetty.com/creativity/perspiration/) – sprint, work determinedly on your best ideas

I highlight research, because I want to draw attention to "prior art". The above articles do not talk about this. (Neither does [this article](https://getlevelten.com/blog/reneed/icedip).) What I've noticed with myself and my peers (during game jams, or other creative periods) is that we want to do something completely original, thereby foregoing a slew of very good ideas in fear of accidentally _copying_ an existing artefact.
 
During your research phase, you will come across prior art. What to do? The old adage is that "good artists copy; great artists steal" ([Quote Investigator, Good Artists Copy; Great Artists Steal, 2013](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/)). This does not mean to plagiarise, but "the golden rule applies: Steal in the way you’d want to be stolen from, with credit, respect, and transformative new ideas" ([Adam J. Kurtz, lifehacker, 2017](https://lifehacker.com/an-artist-explains-what-great-artists-steal-really-me-1818808264)).

We have to realise that "all creative work builds on what came before. Nothing is completely original" ([Steal Like An Artist, Austin Kleon, 2012](https://austinkleon.com/steal/)).

So, I shall go forth, and steal like an artist :-)

**EDIT 2020-10-14**: or you can "re-tell a story" and do a ["de-make"](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-02-the-power-of-demakes-in-the-year-of-next-gen) of your favourite game :-)
