During week 3 of development practice we discuss ideation and prototyping, and I'm briefly reminded of [ICEDIP](https://flex.falmouth.ac.uk/courses/872/pages/week-2-what-is-creativity?module_item_id=44797) in the previous week:

- [Inspiration](http://geoffpetty.com/creativity/inspiration/) – <span class="highlight">research</span>, brainstorm, and generate ideas
- [Clarification](http://geoffpetty.com/creativity/clarification/) – define and focus on goals
- [Evaluation](http://geoffpetty.com/creativity/evaluation/) – pros and cons, strengths and weaknesses of concept, review your work and learn from it 
- [Distillation](http://geoffpetty.com/creativity/distillation/) – decide what you want to leave in or out 
- [Incubation](http://geoffpetty.com/creativity/incubation/) – give the idea some time, sleep on it (folks tend to rush this bit)
- [Perspiration](http://geoffpetty.com/creativity/perspiration/) – sprint, work determinedly on your best ideas 

(All the above links {% cite petty_creativity_1997 %})

I highlight research, because I want to draw attention to "prior art". The above articles do not talk about this. (Neither does [this article](https://getlevelten.com/blog/reneed/icedip).) What I've noticed with myself and my peers (during game jams, or other creative periods) is that we want to do something completely original, thereby foregoing a slew of very good ideas in fear of accidentally _copying_ an existing artefact.
 
During your research phase, you will come across prior art. What to do? The old adage is that "good artists copy; great artists steal" {% cite otoole_good_2013 %}. This does not mean to plagiarise, but "the golden rule applies: Steal in the way you’d want to be stolen from, with credit, respect, and transformative new ideas" {% cite douglas_artist_2017 %}.

We have to realise that "all creative work builds on what came before. Nothing is completely original" {% cite kleon_steal_2012 %}.

Therefore, I shall go forth, and steal like an artist, or perhaps "re-tell a story" and do a "de-make" {% cite evans-thirlwell_demaking_2020 %} of my favourite game.
