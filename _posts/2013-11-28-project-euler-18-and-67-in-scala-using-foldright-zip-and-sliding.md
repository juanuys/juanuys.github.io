<img src="http://distilleryimage6.ak.instagram.com/267f6626581311e3986c12b308e0cf9c_8.jpg" width="50%" align="right"> I've recently applied to [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com/?ref=14568) and sucked miserably at the entry exam. My algo chops were blunt and I thought I'd rectify it by revisiting [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/). With the startup last year and the baby this year I just haven't been able to find the time for programming challenges, but that has to change.

Looking at my Project Euler source directory, I saw that I left it at [problem 17](http://projecteuler.net/problem=17), so next up will be [18](http://projecteuler.net/problem=18). The problem description, however, mentions that the [problem repeats itselt as 67](http://projecteuler.net/problem=67), but with a bigger input that will run 20 billion years if you go the brute force route.

I worked a little on this problem last night, and decided to by-pass the brute force solution completely. It was a bit late, though, and I pulled my eyelids open far enough to make it to bed. I then went on to dream about the damn problem all night. I knew there had to be a simple bottom-up fold-based solution, and the *voila* moment came for me when I realised I had to seed the fold computation with the base layer in the triangle.

Here you go:

# A little explanation

The triangle is represented as a nested list, like so: **List(List(1), List(2, 3), List(4, 5, 6))** and so forth.

<pre>

     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \ / \
 4   5   6    <- this is the "base layer" in my explanation.
</pre>

Since you need to add the maximum of the two immediate children to the layer above, a foldRight wouldn't give me all the info I need in the curent iteration. Foldright for me means "the data is coming FROM the right", i.e. **List(4, 5, 6)** will be processed first, then **List(2, 3)** but at no point in the iteration will they be available together so I can do the sum. **List(4, 5, 6)** would need to come into the iteration with **List(2, 3)** in another way, and I realised I can use the foldRight's accumulator for that by seeding the foldRight with the base layer in the triangle (aka the last list **List(4, 5, 6)**).

The easiest way was to just seed the foldRight with a list of zeros one element larger than the base layer. You then break it up into pairs using **sliding(2,1)**, take the max of the pairs, and sum the max with the corresponding (thanks to **zip**) element in the layer above.

<pre>

      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \ / \
  4   5   6
 / \ / \ / \
0   0   0   0    <- this becomes the new "base layer", or "seed"
</pre>



No mutable state; no recursion; simple to understand. As [Erik Meijer](http://www.applied-duality.com) would say: "baby code".
