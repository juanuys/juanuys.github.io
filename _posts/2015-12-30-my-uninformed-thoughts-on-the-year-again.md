Let's make this a quick one. I'm a busy dad, you know.

First of all, nothing come close to the friendship I've developed with my wee
little girl this year. She's two and a half now, and becoming ever more switched
on. She embraced the recent house move admirably. She also has a sneaky sense of
humour, and will make a great fighter one day. (Coming from a civilised man,
this means intellectual fighting, like the ones you encounter in a court room. Naturally.)

Did I mention a new house? Yes, I did. It's great. Right next to an Ofsted
outstanding (for 20 years running) school. And a park in the back. This means
no-one overlooks us. Which is great. I'm earmarking the garage as a dual study
slash workshop. Stay tuned.

A quick word on tech. I've mostly been at Conde Nast this year, heading up the
API team. Our remit is ever expanding, so soon we'll re-incorporate to something
more "platform team" -like. My immediate team uses JavaScript, but we'll be
doing more Clojure/ClojureScript soon, and have been getting our hands dirty
with a lot of ops involving Kubernetes, Docker, etc.

Personally, I've been doing a lot of stuff in Racket this year. Mostly personal
projects still under wraps.

OK, so my wife is calling me from upstairs now. Talking of which. She is great.
This blog post is dedicated to her. You are a strong, beautiful woman in the
face of all the hiccups you've encountered through-out your life (including
me!). I love you.
