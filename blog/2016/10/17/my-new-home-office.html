    <div class="breaker"></div>
    <div class="body"><p>Due to a growing family, I got kicked out of the spare bedroom I from which I usually work. We have a single garage, and I thought I’d get a couple of quotes to convert it into a rough-and-ready office.</p>

<p>Quotes came in around the £7K to £10K mark, and my first thought was that I didn’t adequately convey the rough-and-readiness I could stomach. (Our plan is to renovate the entire house in a couple of years, so anything done now will be temporary.)</p>

<p>My second thought was “Surely I can do this myself for less”.</p>

<p>And so I did! Besides - I’m no stranger to a spot of DIY.</p>

<p>Initial prep work was done by myself, a door put in by <a href="http://www.mister-constructor.co.uk/">Mister Constructor</a>, and finally the redecorating done by myself and our friend’s dad Colin.</p>

<h2 id="it-starts-with-junk">It starts with junk</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2016-10-17-my-new-home-office/1garage-full-of-crap.jpg" alt="full of crap" /></p>

<p>The first step is to clear the clutter. The doll’s house is going into the shed because I am fixing it up for my daughter before the end of the year. The tools also stay.</p>

<h2 id="access">Access</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2016-10-17-my-new-home-office/2garage-left-wall-door.jpg" alt="how to get in" /></p>

<p>The wall on the left will be where the new backdoor is put in. Note the window on the right - I wanted to take it out and re-use the lintel for a narrow door, but building regulations needed a wider lintel.</p>

<p>After discussions with Mister Constructor, re-installing a bigger lintel would have been a nightmare considering the existing boiler pipework surrounding it.</p>

<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2016-10-17-my-new-home-office/3garage-floor-and-wall-sealed.jpg" alt="seal all the things" /></p>

<p>Firstly, I had to do a few initial preparation tasks, which included</p>

<ul>
  <li>cleaning all the oil spills off the floor</li>
  <li>brushing the walls to remove any loose render</li>
  <li>sealing the floors and walls with water seal</li>
</ul>

<p>In retrospect, this is the stage at which I should’ve painted the walls. The initial plan was to preserve the exposed brick look with a thick varnish, but white paint is distraction free for work and reflects more light. Also, once the floors were down, it was a pain in the rear side to cover them.</p>

<h2 id="access-part-ii">Access part II</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2016-10-17-my-new-home-office/4garage-new-doorway-is-cut-out.jpg" alt="now one can get in from the side" /></p>

<p>For the side-access door, we installed a new regulation-compliant lintel and then cut out doorway using a big loud circular saw.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2016-10-17-my-new-home-office/5garage-new-door-is-in.jpg" alt="and the actual door" /></p>

<p>And here is the actual door. I bought all-glass to maximise light.</p>

<h2 id="the-redecorating-starts">The redecorating starts</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2016-10-17-my-new-home-office/6garage-the-first-ceiling-panel-goes-up.jpg" alt="the first ceiling panel goes up" /></p>

<p>With all the preparations done and the door put in, Colin can start. The first ceiling panel goes in!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2016-10-17-my-new-home-office/7garage-ceiling-done.jpg" alt="ceiling done" /></p>

<p>Cue a montage where Colin and I drink lots of tea and whiz through loads of plasterboard to finish off the ceiling. In real time, this took us a few days. A few times we also confused our lefts with our rights and our ups with our downs - note the unusual patterns ;-)</p>

<h2 id="the-floor">The floor</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2016-10-17-my-new-home-office/8garage-marine-ply-floor-going-in.jpg" alt="the marine ply floor goes in" /></p>

<p>The marine ply floor goes in. Another thing I wish I had done earlier was level the floor. When I sealed the floor, I noticed that it sloped toward the chimney breast as all the liquid collected on one side.</p>

<p>The downside is that one side of the room is an inch lower, and my chair has wheels. Also, I’m yet to do some standing-up work along the length of the space, and the imbalance might do something to my back.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2016-10-17-my-new-home-office/9garage-while-the-floor-settles-I-paint-the-ceiling.jpg" alt="ceiling gets a coat of white" /></p>

<p>While the floor settles down, I paint the ceiling white.</p>

<h2 id="garage-door-no-more">Garage door no more</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2016-10-17-my-new-home-office/10garage-sealing-off-garage-door.jpg" alt="we're sealing off the garage door" /></p>

<p>We seal off the garage door with marine ply and stuff it with Rockwool down the back.</p>

<h2 id="warm-walls">Warm walls</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2016-10-17-my-new-home-office/11garage-insulating-single-skin-walls.jpg" alt="sealing off the single-skin walls" /></p>

<p>We also seal off the single-skin walls to keep the office toasty over winter.</p>

<h2 id="paint-all-the-things">Paint all the things</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2016-10-17-my-new-home-office/12-walls-painted-so-less-dust.jpg" alt="painting the walls to seal in brick dust" /></p>

<p>The brick walls get a few coats of white paint. As alluded to earlier, this is the bit I wish I had done at the start.</p>

<p>And, as you can see, the result is a comfortable little man-cave. Some stuff needs organising. I’m waiting for another IKEA desk and made-to-order mods to raise the trestles so I can stand when I draw.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There you have it. It took me three weeks but a few thousand pounds less than the lowest quote. Throughout I sometimes regretted not just paying someone to do it all in a week, but on the whole, it was fun. I learnt something, consider it a holiday, and also somewhat of an apprenticeship.</p>

<p>I also relish the thought of not having to put my art equipment away when wrap up the day.</p>
