    <div class="body"><p><a href="http://www.beatthatquote.com/">BeatThatQuote</a> (also trading as <a href="http://financeleadsonline.co.uk">Finance Leads Online</a>) was the UK‚Äôs fastest growing start-up in 2005 and won the HSBC regional award for best start-up in the London region. The company‚Äôs core business is generating and selling financial leads. As employee #5 (and the second techie!) I was resposible for implementing backends in Java, and customer self-service front-ends in RoR. BeatThatQuote has since been acquired by Google.</p>

<h1 id="hitting-the-ground-running">Hitting the ground running</h1>

<p>I delivered features the moment I joined. From the get-go, John Newby (my manager) and I had fun competing for lines of code, then less lines of code (because less is more), and number of tickets, delivering as many features possible in a day.</p>

<p>Our office was a single room, and we shared it with loads of other creative and digital teams next to Highgate Studios. Our boss, John Paleomilytes, made a pretty penny with his previous venture, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbboTICo-lY">JCP</a>, which he sold to Sun for a few million. Working with an exprienced entrepreneur was a great privilege. John was very driven and very demanding, and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. I like a founder with a clear vision.</p>

<h1 id="growth">Growth</h1>

<p>The business grew, We recruited, and the team grew. My responsibilities increased, and I was tasked with implementing the direct-to-broker whitelable leads acquisition system in RoR. We also wrote one of the first ever Ajax code (not iFrame + src attribute, but XmlHttpRequest). This was a year before the first jQuery release.</p>

<p>Behold:</p>

<p>I also grew immensely as a developer whilst working for BeatThatQuote.com. The pace was fast, and the tasks demanding. John would stand behind me, waiting for a bit of Ruby to deploy, saying ‚ÄúEvery minute is X thousand pounds‚Äù and my heart would start pounding, and my hands would shake a little. But, I loved every minute of it. Never in your life would you so quickly learn to implement keyboard shortcuts for everything, and never ever even look at your keyboard ever again.</p>

<h1 id="stuff-done">Stuff done</h1>

<p>As always, a bulleted list of a few things I built at BeatThatQuote.com.</p>

<ul>
  <li>MI System - leads submissions system; extended the system with 4 new products
(property, life insurance, pension, and investment) on top of existing loans
and mortgages (Java, PostgresQL)</li>
  <li>Direct 2 Broker system (Ruby on Rails, Ajax); extension to MI system; cuts
out underwriter stage</li>
  <li>IFA self-service system (Java, Struts, Velocity)</li>
  <li>Misc: Ad-hoc reports (Perl); new test framework (Ruby, Watir, Selenium)</li>
</ul>
