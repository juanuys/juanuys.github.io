    <div class="breaker"></div>
    <div class="body"><p>In the week 9 spark forum, we’re asked to imagine starting up as a team. Here’s my individual answer (not my team’s):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Firstly, if we ever changed our name from The Falmouth Foulmouths, it would have to be “Juan, Luis &amp; Partners” (credit: Josh, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis_%26_Partners">wat?</a> link for our non-UK friends). We haven’t discussed working together in the future as a team, although our Team Charter makes provisions for taking the idea further after this module is over (either as a team, or individuals, and things start getting litigious at this point).</p>

  <p>Even though we’re only focusing on making a narrative-branching audio-first game, Luis had the insight to create a platform for distribution and where other authors can easily make similar products. So, I can imagine starting <em>that</em> with the guys, and taking it further. I would probably refer to myself as “CTO”, although I’m more likely to end up an <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-term-Individual-Contributor-Role-the-HR-guys-in-IT-industry-came-up-with-these-days">individual contributor</a>. (“Many stellar developers are interested in only coding and not interested in people management roles.” - their words, not mine 😀) We’ll be as remote as possible, and on a 4-hour-workweek because we’re all Tim Ferriss fanbois (I’m guessing), with communication being entirely via end-to-end encrypted smoke signals (read as: work-life balance, and not an interruption-driven culture).</p>

  <p>The “&amp; Partners” in our name is exactly what it says on the tin: we’ll be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative#Worker_collectives">worker collective</a>. (This is an idea I’ve thrown around on our Discord, as too much money goes to the top nowadays.)</p>

  <p>CYOA is trademarked by ChooseCo, so our slogan will have to be “Choose Your Own Misadventure”, with lots of Grimm/horror themes. Logo? I’ll let Maciej worry about that one.</p>

  <p>How to find success: make good stories. Neil Gaiman is a super nice chap, so it might be worth trying to approach him to get some celebrity cred. Have really good sound design, binaural audio, plenty of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASMR">ASMR</a> vibes. Promote eye health, as you’re not necessarily staring at your device for this one - you can “play” with your eyes closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few things to take note of:</p>

<h1 id="individual-contributor">Individual contributor</h1>

<p>I really do think I’m more likely to do gamedev on my own, and collaborate every now and then with other one-person-indies (i.e. self-starters who knows how to get things done). I like to collaborate with folks in short bursts, and don’t want to be saddled with a company, and be responsible for people’s salaries, or their motivation.</p>

<h1 id="worker-collective">Worker collective</h1>

<p>As much as I dislike seeing so much wealth rise to the top on a daily basis, perhaps starting a collective will be quite hard indeed. Or it won’t happen easily. I think relationships that end up in partnerships like these take a lot of time, so perhaps the “collective” idea will gestate.</p>

<h1 id="work-life-balance">Work-life balance</h1>

<p>I’ve <a href="/blog/2020/10/21/yesterday-today-and-tomorrow.html">quoted</a> Roald Dahl before. Go to <a href="https://www.roalddahl.com/create-and-learn/write/roald-dahl-on-writing">his website</a> and skip to the section labelled “What is your work routine?” (or, listen to it <a href="https://youtu.be/99Q8MaoNvTM">here</a>)
He only writes for 4 hours a day (2 in the morning, and 2 in the afternoon). But, it is deep, focused work <a class="citation" href="#dahl_how_1988">(Dahl 1988)</a>.</p>

<p>I think this is all human beings are capable of. Anyone who sits in an office for 8 or 9 hours a day are fooling themselves and their micro-managing middle-managers. You do a few hours of focused work, if you’re lucky, and the rest of the time is spent on water cooler chatter, meetings, reading the news, going for a long poo so your can swipe through your phone in peace, etc. I’d rather just spend the 3 or 4 hours working, and spend the rest of the day on my own terms.</p>

<h1 id="not-an-interruption-driven-culture-as-remote-as-possible">Not an interruption-driven culture, as remote as possible</h1>

<p>Interruptions are aplenty, and bad for our productivity <a class="citation" href="#noauthor_interruptions_2018">(“Interruptions at Work Are Killing Your Focus, Productivity, and Motivation” 2018)</a>. I won’t allow interruptions at all in my fictitious organisation, and everyone would be tucked away deep inside their Eudaimonia Machine <a class="citation" href="#murray_eudaimonia_2020">(Murray 2020)</a>, in the inner chambers, where deep work happens. (They’re free to come out, of course!) Or, their own little Roald Dahl writing hut <a class="citation" href="#telling_tales_with_carl_ashmore_roald_nodate">(Telling Tales with Carl Ashmore n.d.)</a> (which was actually inspired by Dylan Thomas <a class="citation" href="#noauthor_inside_nodate">(“Inside Roald Dahl’s Writing Hut” n.d.)</a>)</p>

<h1 id="tips-from-the-industry">Tips from the industry</h1>

<p>Lots of good tips from Spry Fox <a class="citation" href="#fray_innovating_2014">(Fray 2014)</a>, but here are the ones specifically about remote teamwork:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep prototypes so small that you only need max 2 people on it initially (e.g. designer + programmer, or a lone technical designer)</li>
  <li>No paper prototypes (as the team is remote, digital prototypes work better)</li>
  <li>timezones can be a PITA, but you can hire the best people</li>
  <li>chemistry can be difficult to achieve over video chat</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-development-log">Week development log</h1>

<h2 id="2021-07-25-sunday">2021-07-25 Sunday</h2>

<p>Started preparing for the 3-minute demo video for the final submission:</p>
<ul>
  <li>have all art downloaded and in a central location</li>
  <li>have all SFX downloaded and in a central location</li>
  <li>have all ambient sound (forest + footsteps) downloaded and in a central location</li>
  <li>all imported into a new iMovie project</li>
  <li>started a doc on Google Docs detailing the plan for the video</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-rest-of-the-week">The rest of the week</h2>

<p>I’m waiting on the rest of the team for their assets so I can start making the 3 minute demo video. I feel frustrated, because everything will be ready just as I am about to <em>move again</em> (on July 31st), this time to an AirBN in Stroud, for one month. The move will disrupt my free time over the weekend, and the early part of the following week.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I’m researching pitch decks so we can make an impact with our final assignment. (And updating blogs, of course!)</p>
