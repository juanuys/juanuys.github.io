<p><em>TL;DR</em> If you’re a laptop-toting *nix user, then this is the laptop for you. Also, upgrade the kernel before you do anything else, for the best experience.</p>

<p>This advice is highly unqualified, though. The last time I ran *nix on a laptop was when I ran some flavour of Gentoo on an old Centrino-loaded HP in 2005. I’ve been a Mac user ever since those darned iPhones came out.</p>

<p>It’s just that I ran out of space on my 128GB SSD Air for the umpteenth time, and shuddered at the thought of breaking off glued-down components according to some <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Air+13-Inch+Mid+2013+Solid-State+Drive+Replacement/151810">iFixit guide</a>. (Damnit! I just looked again, and there’s no glue involved in upgrading the SSD. Oh, well — the missus needed a new laptop anyway, and this was a welcome hand-me-down. Besides: new toys!)</p>

<h1 id="first-things-first">First thing’s first</h1>

<p>When you do get one of these bad boys, the first thing I recommend you do is this:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/opyate/7276520">https://gist.github.com/opyate/7276520</a></p>

<p>That will get you the latest kernel without upgrading <em>everything</em>. As any Linux user would know, upgrading to fix one problem introduces a thousand other problems, and this felt like a nice trade-off.</p>

<p>The reason for the above command is that I did have some wifi stability issues to start with, so I hope to save you that initial few dropped connections.</p>

<p><em>Once again, kudos to <a href="http://popey.com/">popey</a> over on the #ubuntu-uk IRC channel for the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack">advice</a>.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lj9GnWi.png" /></a></p>

<p>Wifi has been stable and pretty quick. I suppose it’s not all down to the new kernel and drivers: I have Virgin 60Mb fibre optic, and my walls are refreshingly free of tin foil.</p>

<h1 id="the-gear">The gear</h1>

<p>The XPS 13 comes packed with some great specs which <a href="http://www.dell.com/uk/business/p/xps-13-linux/pd">you can gloss over here</a>, but I’ll re-iterate the key components: Intel® Core™ i7-3537U CPU @ 2.00GHz × 4, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD of which 230-odd usable and a mega bright 13.3” screen all on a pretty little laptop that feels like an 11” one. I never put the brightness above a third of the available level, and at 1920 x 1080 it looks great.</p>

<p>The keyboard still sports a Windows button, but it’s the new Windows logo which I’m not familiar with yet, and I pass it off in my mind as a generic “dashboard” type button, so it’s all good. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux">Tux</a> button would probably be a bit weird. I mean, what would a penguin button do? Summon a troop of penguins? Nah. Besides, penguins — just like seals and dolphins — can be <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/wild_things/2013/10/28/sea_otter_dolphin_and_penguin_behavior_your_favorite_animals_are_jerks.html">dirty little scumbags</a>.</p>

<h1 id="the-ever-so-scientific-bench-test">The ever-so-scientific bench test</h1>

<p>I needed GIMP for something last night, and when I installed it and launched it for the first time, the realisation hit me that it all took about 30 seconds.</p>

<p>So, I purged GIMP and re-did it for your viewing pleasure:</p>

<div class="videowrapper">
<iframe width="1665" height="764" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gt0H4_QUvzE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>Apart from this, I’m running about multiple Java server apps (for this thing I’m working on), plus a couple of VMs, plus some Python scripts that are running some numbers. My software does make efficient use of all the available cores, and CPU hasn’t been a problem for me in a while.</p>

<p>All the Linux games available on Steam runs like a dream. Just the addition of Steam of a *nix system feels like we’ve come full circle.</p>

<h1 id="qualms">Qualms</h1>

<p>It’s early days — a lot might still happen. In fact, Murphy’s Law states that I’ll publish this favourable review and it will be shortly followed by the i7 going up in smoke.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are some of my initial qualms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The mouse is triggered sometimes whilst typing. This is configurable, and I have switched it to disable the mouse whilst typing, but to no avail.</li>
  <li>The password box looses focus more times than not, and you end up typing your password in unfavourable places. This could be related to the previous issue discussed.</li>
  <li>Keyboard is ever so slightly flimsy, because sometimes letters will double up. Perhaps this is just a keyboard I need to get used to. Besides, I’ve used the Mac chiclet-style keyboards exlusively since 2009.</li>
  <li>The palm rests — even though they feel great to the touch — seems to get a bit streaky after a while. My fingers are constantly greasy from chowing on ginger biscuits and stuff like that, and it doesn’t wipe down well.</li>
  <li>The backspace button does make a slight squeaky sound sometimes, but this could be because my pinky finger “pulls” on the button due to the angle I attack it with. Still — I don’t think this should happen.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="outro">Outro</h1>

<p>If anything else pops up, or if the XPS 13 makes my life significantly better in any other way, I’ll come back here to amend. (I won’t do those silly <strong>UPDATE</strong> things at the bottom — you can look at the <a href="https://github.com/opyate/opyate.github.io/commits/master/_posts/2013-11-02-dell-xps-13-linux-edition-makes-me-happy.md">Git history of this page</a> for changes.)</p>

<p>This is my first ever piece of Dell equipment, and it doesn’t look nor feel like a grey, impersonal piece of office equipment. Also, Mr. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth">Mark Hails-From-The-Same-Home-Town-As-I Shuttleworth</a> got things very right with Ubuntu. Linux has certainly come a long way since that day in 1995 when my mate dropped off 25-odd floppies of Slackware.</p>

<p>I’m more productive than ever and won’t be going back to Apple. I certainly don’t want to shoehorn OSX into a usable system with macports any time soon.</p>
