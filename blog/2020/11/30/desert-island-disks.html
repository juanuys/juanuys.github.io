    <div class="body"><p>Fellow student Will wrote a post called <a href="https://wil1333.wixsite.com/mysite/post/desert-island-disks">desert island disks</a>, and asked for ours. Here goes.</p>

<h1 id="5-ultima-underworld-the-stygian-abyss">5. Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020-11-30-desert-island-disks/abyss.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Underworld:_The_Stygian_Abyss">The Stygian Abyss</a> was my favourite game as I entered my teenage years. I would think about the game whilst at school, drawing underground worlds in my notebook until the closing bell. Then I’d rush home, but having a feeling of dread at the thought of going into the scary dungeons yet again.</p>

<p>It was the first first-person 3D game I ever played. Even playing Wolfenstein 3D afterwards didn’t live up to it, even if released 2 months after - Wolf 3D’s gameplay and viewpoint was limited to a single plane, I guess to make the game faster, whereas you could look up and down in Abyss.</p>

<p>There were 8 very large underground levels to explore, but I remember it feeling like 50.</p>

<p>It’s infinitely replayable, as you can create different characters and find a different way through the dungeons every time.</p>

<h1 id="4-jack-nicklaus-unlimited-golf--course-design">4. Jack Nicklaus’ Unlimited Golf &amp; Course Design</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020-11-30-desert-island-disks/golf.gif" alt="Screenshot of Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf &amp; Course Design" /></p>

<p>Not only did I and my late father play a lot of <em>actual</em> golf when I was young, but we played a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus%27_Unlimited_Golf_%26_Course_Design">Jack Nicklaus</a> too.</p>

<p>Everything about the game was great - the long manual which taught you how to design courses, the beautifully colourful and embossed box, and of course the game itself. Having more time than my dad, I would make him a new course once in a while.</p>

<p>I have to add, though - my favourite memories of my dad is not playing the video game together, but finishing the 18th hole every Saturday just to kick back at the club house with a basket of fries and a basket of chillies, him with a beer, and me with a not beer.</p>

<h1 id="3-diablo-ii">3. Diablo II</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020-11-30-desert-island-disks/diablo.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Diablo II" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_II">Diablo II</a> hit me during my uni years, which means my grades weren’t as good as they ought to have been. I used to hear the haunting game music in my head whilst in the lecture hall, or studying at my desk. I guess the same way I used to see Tetris when I closed my eyes many years earlier as a SNES fanboy.</p>

<p>Again, infinite replayability, as you can create different characters with different traits, and the wilderness and dungeons are generated. It reminded me so much of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_VIII:_Pagan">Pagan</a> which I played endlessly a few years before, but it was so much better.</p>

<h1 id="2-command-and-conquer-red-alert-2">2. Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020-11-30-desert-island-disks/redalert.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II">Dune II</a> was easy to beat - you just had to build a path all the way to your enemy base, and they’d attack the path instead of you, while you flanked them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_(video_game)">Z</a> was punk-rock fun, which suited rebellious teenage me perfectly, but it lacked resource management.</p>

<p>I guess that’s why I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert_2">Red Alert II</a> so much. It’s perfectly balanced, and the cut-scenes were hilariously hammy.</p>

<p>For a brief time after uni, I was a struggling musician, living in a house with my bandmates and some of our actor friends. (In retrospect, how did we all ever manage rent!?). In-between gigs, band practice, or writing songs with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cakewalk_(sequencer)">Cakewalk Pro</a>, life was made of Red Alert II. Happy days.</p>

<h1 id="1-deus-ex">1. Deus Ex</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2020-11-30-desert-island-disks/deusex.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Deus Ex" /></p>

<p>OK, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game)">now here’s a game</a> I’ve played a few times already, and nothing comes close. The mood is undeniably oppressive cyber dystopian future - I was getting through a lot of William Gibson at the time, so the game gave me an outlet to exist in a similar world. I have a bit of an obsession with “cyber dystopia” games, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicate_(1993_video_game)">Syndicate</a> being a favourite from a few years earlier.</p>

<p>I even pretended to be a hacker once and attended the Johannesburg chapter of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2600:_The_Hacker_Quarterly">2600</a> meetups (I did again a few years later in London, and made some good friends). But, I have to say, it was more fun being JC Denton than sitting in a mall cafeteria with a bunch of shade-wearing dudes (they might get “recognised”).</p>

<p>You could bomb and blast your way through a game, and try it as a lock-picking stealthmeister in your next run. You can mod weapons, you can mod yourself. NPC interactions really meant something. The world felt alive.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Similarly to Will, my list has very good replay value. There are other favourites, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2">Half-Life 2</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty">StarCraft II</a> (I see a sequel pattern emerging…), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Elysium">Disco Elysium</a>… But the games in the list above were formative in a sense, and gave me my fondest memories.</p>

<p>What are YOUR desert island disks?</p>
