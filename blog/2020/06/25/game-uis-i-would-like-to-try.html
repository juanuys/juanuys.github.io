    <div class="body"><h1 id="thoughts-as-a-user-interface">Thoughts as a user interface</h1>

<p>Imagine this (da-da-tish): the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink">NeuraLink</a> BMI has been around for a while now, and you got one last Xmas. You missed the chicken (turkey is too dry) roast, because you were still sedated. There weren‚Äôt any side-effects. Well, there weren‚Äôt any <em>severe</em> side-effects: now, whenever you stub your toe, you see Keanu Reeves‚Äô face. Bill &amp; Ted Keanu, not Johnny Mnemonic Keanu, although the latter would have been apt. Also, you can‚Äôt taste gooseberries anymore. Which is not a big deal, because they‚Äôre sour as hell. Like I said, not severe.</p>

<p>You like to play games, and a new Prey is out. It‚Äôs the usual you-don‚Äôt-see-them-coming, then bang-bang, but then this: <span class="highlight">they can smell your thoughts</span>. (DirectBrain was bundled with the latest DirectX and all of a sudden game developers all over the world could put audio and visuals right in your head. And if you‚Äôve read and agreed to the extra privacy policy which no-one ever reads but always agrees to, they now had access to your thoughts.)</p>

<p>The alien which was a suitcase a moment ago has now taken its true form, and staring you down, gazing into your pinprick irises. Are you afraid of me? Do you want to hurt me? Think carefully, otherwise you‚Äôll be her chicken roast.</p>

<p>We could also be a bit less exciting and more mechanical and just have the game know which story or NPC conversation avenues you want to explore by thinking it. Instead of click-click, you just think ‚Äúyup‚Äù, ‚Äúno‚Äù.</p>

<h1 id="wearables-as-a-user-interface">Wearables as a user interface</h1>

<p>Your favourite RPG has downloadable recipes for 3D-printing your character‚Äôs accessories. The Ring of Everlasting Fire is gone from the character inventory where it‚Äôs been since v1, but you can now print it (if you use red filament, of course) and slip it onto your finger.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">The game knows you‚Äôre wearing the ring</span>, because your Kinect can see it on your hand. Or, the game‚Äôs companion mobile app looks at you through your phone‚Äôs camera, or your webcam. Or, if BMI tech is here already, you would have seen yourself slipping the ring on, and the game would know. The game would also know if you try and secretly slip it off again behind your back, because‚Ä¶ thoughts.</p>

<h1 id="home-as-a-user-interface">Home as a user interface</h1>

<p>Monomi Park founder Nick Popovich recently talked about making games that stand out and survive, but there was a portion of the talk that was so good and could have had it‚Äôs own video: <a href="https://youtu.be/DTvBgmNL-p0?t=1962">A place to call Home</a>. Go and watch it quickly if you hadn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>Even though Nick says that his definition of home isn‚Äôt a literal home base in your game, I‚Äôm saying it could be. You‚Äôre playing GTA VI and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Philips">Trevor Philips</a> is back. <span class="highlight">When he enters the safe house, it is your house</span> which you lovingly and painstakingly captured last week using <a href="https://get.display.land/">display.land‚Äôs</a> photogrammetry app. If it‚Äôs GTA Online, your friends can come and visit too, and admire your new wall rugs.</p>

<h1 id="quantified-self-as-a-user-interface">Quantified Self as a user interface</h1>

<p><span class="highlight">The better you do, the better your avatar does.</span> Have you covered your 10,000 steps today? Recycling Trevor Philips for a minute, next time he runs, he doesn‚Äôt get out of breath quite so quickly. Did you log your meals today? Lots of greens? Well, Trevor has a healthier complexion and is quicker-witted and this affects NPCs in interesting ways. Did you put some savings aside this month? Trevor can afford those new kicks he‚Äôs always wanted.</p>

<p>Reverse/inverted Tamagotchi, anyone?</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>I‚Äôm aware we started off a bit with a moonshot idea, but the other things discussed here can be implemented today. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm by no means the only or first person to have come up with these ideas (we never are), and I‚Äôm sure there are areas of AR which already cover some of these topics.</p>
