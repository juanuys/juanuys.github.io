# Goals

## Become more fluent with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/)

Set on 2020-10-25.

| Component | Description |
| --------- + ----------- |
| Specific | I became more fluent with the Phaser game engine... |
| Measurable | ...when I discovered that I don't need to consult the docs anymore, and I had a good grasp of the advanced features. |
| Achievable | This was possible by only using Phaser for all game development, trying out all Phaser features during game jams, and being active on the Phaser Discord. |
| Relevant / Realistic | Focusing on Phaser turned out to be a good decision for me, due to my history with web development, and the studio's focus on online titles. |
| Time-bound | I reached this level by mid-2021. |
| Emotional attachment | I felt great pleasure being able to fluently make games without getting stuck and having to resort to docs or Discord every other minute. |
| Reward | The reward was the state of flow I achieved with every game development project. |

## Be a better designer

Set on 2020-10-25.

| Component | Description |
| --------- + ----------- |
| Specific | I became a better game designer... |
| Measurable | ...by releasing video games that people thought were super fun (stretch: that won a game jam; that was lauded for its design; that was featured favourably in a GMTK video) |
| Achievable | I incorporated appropriate design considerations from my literature with every game I made, and entered at least <span class="highlight">one game jam per month</span> to hone my skills. (stretch: I made a small game exercising a new design methodology <span class="highlight">every week</span>, each time asking for feedback about the impact of the design decision from play testers.) |
| Relevant / Realistic | Better design turned out to be very relevant, as my badly designed or bland games were shunned regardless of good graphics or interesting characters. |
| Time-bound | Exercising and fine-tuning one aspect of a design methodology every week turned out to be achievable. |
| Emotional attachment | When I didn't become a better designer, making games became just another computer programming exercise. |
| Reward | The reward was in the outcome itself: more people liked my games, which means I could afford to make games full-time. |
