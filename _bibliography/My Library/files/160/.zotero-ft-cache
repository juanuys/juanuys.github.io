Challenge Brief

Use the following eight criteria to formulate a narrative design document for your indie game prototype. If your game idea is more abstract, perhaps not all categories will apply. However, remember how powerful a force a story can be in engaging players. For example, Rovio’s Angry Birds could have been presented as an abstract physics simulation – by adding appealing characters and an easily understandable backstory, it became not only a wildly popular game, but a franchise for feature films and merchandise.

1. Setting
	

What kind of world does the game take place in? Consider the time and place, what kind of society this is, and what different cultures reside there.

Also think about the geography and geology, as well as what plants and animal life exist. What are the rules of this universe? For example, is this a place close to mundane reality, or somewhere more magical and fantastic?

2. Characters
	

Who are the main protagonists and antagonists in this world? Do they follow or contradict established archetypes, such as the hero, the mentor, the villain, the monster or the princess? What do the characters want that motivates them to take actions within the story? Who or what is the ‘mascot’ that features prominently in the game’s marketing?

(We explore the visual design of these characters next week.)

3. Plot
	

What happens in the story? Does the plot follow an established structure such as the hero’s journey, or murder mystery? If so, how do the different elements of those structures translate to gameplay? What conflicts drive events forward? How can the overarching plot be broken down into smaller gameplay segments? How does the plot resolve – does the hero save the day, or is life never that simple?

4. Mood
	

How should the player be feeling while they play through the game and experience the story? Perhaps they should be scared, excited, awed, relaxed or amused at different points. How do you establish these moods? Is the gameplay in harmony with the story: how can you avoid ‘ludonarrative dissonance’?

5. Narrative Structure
	

At what point do we enter the story? For example, do we start from a position of stability, which is later disrupted, or do we jump straight into the action, and fill in the backstory later?

Remember the power of mystery to keep the audience engaged. Does the game take place in one continuous flow of time, or does it jump around? Are there multiple protagonists or narrators?

6. Storytelling Techniques
	

What methods are used to tell the story? For example, narration, illustrations, comic strips, cut-scenes, FMV (full motion video), dialogue, quests, audiologs, environmental storytelling and level design.

Does the player have to do a lot of passive reading, watching or listening? What is the balance between story exposition and gameplay?

7. Interactivity
	

How much agency does the player have in how the story unfolds? Are they just going along for the ride, or can their decisions change the course of events? What is the relationship between the main protagonist or avatar, and the player? Is the protagonist a silent blank-slate for the player to project themselves onto, or are they a well-defined character with desires and motivations?

8. Theme
	

Is there an overall theme or meaning to the game’s narrative? What is the player supposed to have learned by the end of it?

When you formulate your narrative, your post should follow this format (ie copy-paste the format and write below each criteria heading):

Feel free to add illustrations, diagrams and samples of dialogue, quest design, or anything else you feel would play an important part in the storytelling. In a professional context, this would make up part of the game design document (GDD).
 
Share

Please share your narrative design document in the forum below, along with a reflection on the experience of creating it, and highlight any issues or questions that arose through the process. For ease of sharing, we recommend you create your document as a blog post rather than a downloadable file, unless you really want to present it in a special way.

Please also read a few other submissions, and leave some constructive feedback on the forum. Would you be excited to experience this story? Maybe there is something that could be better? How realistic is the scope of the story within the context of this module? Perhaps you could suggest ways to improve or simplify another student’s ideas.

Don’t forget to post your results and experience in your blog too.
 

Generally, you should spend up to a week on the challenge activity. We will discuss the challenge activity work in next week’s webinar. Try not to post too close to the webinar date however, to allow enough time for others to review and give feedback.

You may need more time on certain challenge activities, particularly when you feel it is an area you need to explore more and / or the work directly contributes to your assignment. This is fine, and you can document your learning process in your journal. However, plan carefully so it does not affect your study workload too much.

We also encourage you to share, even if you feel your work is not quite complete or ‘perfect’ – the peer feedback would be valuable.
