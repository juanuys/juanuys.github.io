AGILE ESSENTIALS
Manifesto for Agile Software Development

The Agile Manifesto was written in 2001 by seventeen independent-minded software practitioners. While the participants didn’t often agree, they did find consensus around four core values.

The Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Working software over comprehensive documentation

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
