Founded in 2004, Games for Change is a 501(c)3 nonprofit that empowers game creators and social innovators to drive real-world impact through games and immersive media. We convene industry experts through our annual Games for Change Festival , inspire youth to explore civic issues and STEAM skills through our Student Challenge , and showcase leading impact-focused games and immersive experiences through live Arcades for the public.

XR for Change

XR for Change was launched in 2017. The initiative aims to develop a community of practice to use immersive media to address real-world challenges, foster collaboration between content creators, advance equity and inclusion and inspire creative use of emerging technologies for social impact.
Game Exchange

Game Exchange is a new G4C program supported by the Stevens Initiative. The virtual program will bring together teens from the U.S. Bahrain, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates to join in creative dialogue and collaboration based on games and game design. Over two years, the program will serve nearly 3,000 students.
Student Challenge

The G4C Student Challenge is the leading national game design program and competition that combines students’ passion for games with digital learning & civic engagement. Now in its 6th year, the program runs in Atlanta, Detroit, Los Angeles and NYC – as well as nationally through virtual opportunities for teachers and students.
