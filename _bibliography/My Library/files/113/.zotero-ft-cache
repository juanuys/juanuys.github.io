Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)
 WHAT is GOAP?
Goal-Oriented Action Planning (aka GOAP, rhymes with soap) refers to a simplfied STRIPS-like planning architecture specifically designed for real-time control of autonomous character behavior in games. I originally implemented GOAP for F.E.A.R. while working at Monolith Productions . This A.I. architecture simultaneously powered Monolith's Condemned: Criminal Origins . (Brian Legge was responsible for the A.I. in Condemned). My GOAP implementation was inspired by conversations within the A.I. Interface Standards Committee's ( AIISC ) GOAP Working Group, as well as ideas from the Synthetic Characters Group's C4 agent architecture at the MIT Media Lab , and Nils Nilsson's description of STRIPS planning in his AI book .
