WIP: Contumacious Commuter
Run game

The game is not done, but please check it out and leave feedback anyway  ðŸ˜ƒ

Current issues:

    SFX isn't working in the web version of the game (this one), e.g. card shuffling noises, or attack sounds
    when it says "Your turn", the cards aren't always clickable, and it takes a few tries before the blue telegraphing arrow appears
    only the bottom half of cards seem to be clickable 


Rekindling an old game idea for a uni project.

You are Fenyx, a public transport -shy wimp whose pet neko, Scratt, has been kidnapped by Br Ã¼ li . Fenyx must face their fears, get on the train, and endure the annoyances of the commute (aka "train battles") to go and rescue their beloved pet.
