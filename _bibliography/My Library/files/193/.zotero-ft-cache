The 4 years of self-imposed crunch that went into Stardew Valley

Is crunch time still unconscionable even when it’s self-imposed? You have to wonder when you hear about one 28-year-old Seattleite's grueling four-year quest to make the ultimate farming sim.

"On average, I probably worked on it 10 hours a day every day of the week during development," says Eric Barone. "Now that the game is out, I'm probably spending more like 15 hours a day on it."

He’s talking about his one-man labor of love Stardew Valley , which began as an homage to the classic franchise Harvest Moon . Eventually, Barone dreamed of creating the ultimate apotheosis of Harvest Moon --a game that was equally soothing and idyllic, but vaster and more ambitious than anything Natsume ever dreamed of.

"My experiences playing Harvest Moon are priceless and have had a deep impact on me, and I wanted my own game to have that kind of power," says Barone. "However, I know that to make a great game you can't just create 'art'... the game needs to be fun."

The first step was admitting that the game he idolized could be improved upon. "The gameplay in Harvest Moon was usually fun, but I felt like no title in the series ever brought it all together in a perfect way," says Barone. "My idea with Stardew Valley was to address the problems I had with Harvest Moon , as well as create more 'purpose' with tried-and-true gameplay elements such as crafting and quests."

Players eventually discover a deep crafting system, as well as dungeons and mines beyond the sprawling farmland and the well-populated town. Bored picking vegetables? Go slay some monsters or forge something from precious metal.

Eric Barone says he spent approximately 70 hours per week hammering on Stardew Valley  for the last 4 years. Now that it's out, he's spending far more time responding to player comments. [via PC Gamer ]

    "I think I'm stuck in the past. But it's a past where game worlds were creative and magical"

It's an ambitious project, especially since Barone was only 24 at the time he announced it on Steam Greenlight. "I've always been obsessed with creating stuff," he says, "For as long as I can remember, I spent my spare time doodling, making music, writing... basically all the different aspects of making a game. I just didn't know at the time that I would find a way to combine all those things to bring a cohesive vision to life."

He created every bit of the game's art and graphics and code, and it has a lovely retro aesthetic that suggests...well, it suggests a creator  who immersed himself in a 20-year-old franchise for most of his twenties.  "At some point, I got older and lost touch with the games 'scene;'" he says.

There's no time to keep up with everything happening when you're pouring 70 hours a week into your raison detre . "In many ways, I think I'm stuck in the past," adds Barone. "But it's a past where game worlds were creative and magical... a celebration of that special, overwhelming feeling of wonder that we experience as children."

His passion project was released on February 26th, and it's already a massive hit. It's received  excellent reviews and over 300,000 sales (according to SteamSpy ). Part of this might be credited to his attentiveness to his fan community. He sought feedback on the game concept via Steam Greenlight, then refused to do an Early Access campaign or accept money till it was feature complete.

    "You should be free to work yourself to the bone, but not to force someone else to do that for you"

All the while, he kept fans informed of how he was progressing via Reddit and Twitter. Now that the game is out, he has ratcheted up his dedication, attempting to patch away every flaw that players have discovered. And he promises expansions and updates galore.

Barone has amassed so much goodwill that even  people pirating his game  are posting on the torrents about how the fully intend to buy it someday. Other fans responded by buying extra copies to give to anyone who can't afford the game, or was planning on pirating it. 

"My strategy with the community is simple: no strategy at all!" says Barone. "I think that, as an indie developer, you should just be yourself and be a real human. I try to act online like I do in real life: treat everyone with respect, and be as honest and straightforward as possible." 

The only dark cloud hanging over this pastoral paradise are misgivings about just how much time Barone spends on the game. In this post- EA Spouse world, it's hard not to wince when you hear about someone has condemned himself to years of perpetual crunch. What drives him to do that?

"It's both passion and discipline," says Barone. "I think it's a lot easier to stay driven when you're doing your own project, knowing that there are no limits to how far you can go."

"I'm choosing to do this much work because I want to be an indie game developer and see my project come to fruition," he adds. "While those developers at EA were, in effect, forced to work against their will. I don't think it's right. You should be free to work yourself to the bone, but not to force someone else to do that for you."

There were times during development that I didn't feel like working, that I even wanted to quit entirely," he concedes.

"Looking back, I think the development was characterized by phases of insane productivity followed by phases where I hardly worked at all," says Barone. "I'm not sure if there was any technique to it or if it was just a quirk of my brain chemistry. I did always have a ridiculous amount of faith in myself and in the game, and yet I knew that I was still a nobody and the only way I could change that was to work super hard."

"It does help if you can absolutely convince yourself that you're destined for greatness," says Barone. "It's not even an ego thing--it's just a way to prevent doubt and insecurity from hindering you."

I've been following the development of Stardew Valley since it was announced on Greenlight in 2012, and have been totally blown away by just how much Eric nailed everything. It feels like Harvest Moon but transcends the series in ways that it's a bit mind-boggling only one guy worked on it. I think this article gets why Stardew Valley has been so successful: Eric was always open and honest about what he was developing. He posted monthly updates on his site and would discuss features and plans with fans on Twitter, even years before the game was released.

So it was a pretty grueling development period, by any standard. It's an amazing game though, and with the success it's had he'll be able to afford a comfortable retirement any time he wants. Losing 4 years of your life to secure the remaining 50 probably doesn't sound like a bad trade-off for most people.

That is also a really good trailer. The gameplay and the music sell it perfectly.

Even if he makes only $5.00 per copy (take out the other $10.00 for Steam/GOG, publisher, and taxes), he's already made more than $2 million USD in just the first two weeks. For me that'd be more than enough to live comfortably right up to the grave.

I don't get why Gamasutra of all things is glorifying crunch. Stardew Valley's success has nothing to do with crunching; it's simply a good game on any timeline. In fact science says crunch made this game take longer, no matter the size of the team. Maybe everything worked out for this one title but there are countless others who work hard or harder and never achieve the level of success this title has seen.

That's why we answer all those surveys every year about crunching. Because our industry has a success bias and we need to give the rest of the developers a voice. Why counter that momentum by saying it's ok to hurt yourself as long as you aren't hurting others? Many people will now go on to make their lives unhappier through crunch, holding onto a dream of becoming Stardew Valley that isn't any more real than if they never crunched at all. Also the person who believes that may go on one day to join someone else's team or lead their own and find that their personal endeavor to crunch impacts other people's lives even if they don't mean it to.

I don't think the article suggests that the success of Stardew Valley correlates with the crunching habits of its developer.
Elon Musk gave the advice to entrepreneurs to work about twice as many hours as a normal work week would have. Which is effectively what Eric did. When he had to defend this advice he said that it improves the odds of success.
I agree with that notion and if Eric had worked only regular hours for 4 years I highly doubt he would have been as successful.

This is because the expectations for the quality&quantity of content in Indie Games has risen to an incredibly high level by now.
Notably I'm not saying that's a good thing, but if he worked regular hours I can't imagine that he would have been able to meet these expectations in 4 years.

I donÂ´t think that he hurt himself at all, much less made himself unhappy by working on the project. Since itÂ´s such a personal work itÂ´s not really comparable to the conditions of working as an employee for a studio. This kind of work comes from an intrinsic motivation that i believe can not be found otherwise.

The anti-crunch stories we hear tend to focus on developers trapped by obligations to families and finances but that's only part of the picture. Equally big, if not bigger, is that young talent is highly valuable in the games industry specifically because young talent is intrinsically motivated ("to work in games") and that motivation can be exploited to get them to work more hours for less money.

For that reason alone I don't think intrinsic motivation is enough to make crunch okay. But I agree there's a bit of a philosophical edge to it if you're discussing a team of strictly one person.

I don't want to specifically condemn this developer or any other developer for their choices and behavior, I just wanted to call out the confusing message of seeing an article championing crunch on Gamasutra.

Exactly. Even if it is okay to hurt yourself as long as you aren't hurting others (a principle with which I agree), crunching voluntarily *isn't* just hurting yourself - it's indirectly hurting everyone else by reinforcing the notion that for passionate people - and especially game developers - crunch is natural and to be expected.

Why do you see this article as "championing crunch"? It seems like it's just an article about the development of Stardew Valley, with no judgement one way or the other about the schedule Barone worked in the process.

Would it have been more acceptable if the interviewer had snuck in a comment somewhere condemning him for that? Or should they simply have excluded his answer about the schedule entirely?

@Kyle Redd: "Why do you see this article as "championing crunch""

Come on, the title of this article is "The 4 years of self-imposed crunch" ... it can't be any clearer.

"4 years of self-imposed crunch" completely vindicates Andrew Pellerano points.

"4 years of self-imposed crunch" - Personally this doesn't read as glorifying at all. It is simply describing the work schedule that led to Stardew Valley. In fact if anything it's leaning towards being critical of the schedule, because "crunch" has been a four-letter word in game development circles for a while now. A slightly more neutral headline to me would have been "The 4-years of 70-hour work weeks that went into Stardew Valley"

How would you re-write that headline in a way that you feel would not be championing crunch?

I guess there's two ways to interpret the headline and both ways make valid points. I think different people can see it different ways.

However, we both know all too often statements like "4 years of self-imposed crunch" has been heald up in our industry as a massive achievement. Its been that way for decades, and that achievement most definately is glorifying it.

We also still have a culture of crunch. Its not suddenly gone away, just because people say its bad. It still happens all too often to the point of being the norm in most companies. Oh they say they are trying to reduce it but it doesn't happen in most companies. There's always have a reason why more is needed. So yes, crunching is still heald up by our industry as an achievement. So talking about that attitude is valid.

I honestly don't think they wrote the article that in any way glorifies or condemns the manner in which the game was developed. It seems like your issue is more with the headline than the article itself. If the headline had simply excluded the crunch aspect: "The 4-year development of Stardew Valley" for example, but had the exact same text in the body of the article, would you then believe that it was not glorifying crunch at all?

@"It seems like your issue is more with the headline than the article itself. "

No, from also the article ... e.g.

"On average, I probably worked on it 10 hours a day every day of the week during development," says Eric Barone. "Now that the game is out, I'm probably spending more like 15 hours a day on it."

Deny it all you like, even try splitting hairs over it if you like as you try to refuse to see its bad, it doesn't matter, because in the end, ultimately its your own health that will pay, as I'm starting to find out. Try learning from example before its too late for you. Or keep denying it, its your choice and your loss. We each try so hard to succeed, but you can't keep up that pace as you keep trying without serious health problems and they can hit you very hard at any time ... like during 4 year periods of crunch.

By way of background, I am a physician entering fellowship (neuroradiology) in a few months. I have never worked in game development professionally, my experience with coding/game design was as a hobby during my teen years and a few years of undergraduate courses before deciding that medicine was my thing.

I realize that there are a lot of issues specific to the game development industry that I know nothing about, but one thing I do know a lot about is long hours in a high stress work environment.

70 hours a week for four years in game development sounds like a great schedule. Not to mention this guy could literally stop and take a break at any moment if he really wanted to.

I have been limited by law to averaging no more than 80 hours a week during residency (for the past five years) and you better believe if the hospital could squeeze any more hours out of me legally then they would. The four years prior to that was medical school, where there are no hours restrictions and I would have killed to work (i.e. class and studying) only 80 hours per week.

I am in good health and quite happy (I do take medication for depression but have been doing so since long before medical school). I also have 4 kids and about as solid of a marriage as one could hope for.

I get really, really tired of people claiming that their "long" hours at work make a healthy life impossible. Long work hours may make it more challenging to maintain a healthy lifestyle (both emotionally and physically), but they don't make it impossible or even improbable.

I don't doubt that there are some very serious problems with health in the game development industry, but I suspect that the "hurting oneself" you refer to has far more to do with the specifics of one's situation (positive vs negative work environment, personal relationships, financial situation etc.) than they do with the "crunch."

I can say this unequivocally, you're insane thinking that 70-80 hours a week, practically indefinitely, is a good work/life blalance.

Good luck with, like the poster said above, not going Karōshi in a couple of years.

Junior doctors are notorious for dying due to over work, so don't try to say there is no health effects. Try reading up on the subject rather than you making assumptions.

I don't even believe you are a doctor. Because if you are, then you very evidently need a lot more training, because there is so much research against your point of view.

IÂ´m severely impressed, the game looks better and more imaginative than some games that were done by teams of 10 people or more. You can really feel the love that went into making it. When someone is driven by so much passion I actually find it unfitting to call it crunch just because he put so much time in it. I believe that creating a personal work with this kind of dedication is an experience that you can look upon with joy for the rest of your life.
Congratulations, Eric!

I have always been interested in the genre of Animal Crossing / Harvest Moon but always felt like the games were incomplete or missing something. After seeing it on Steam in my queue, I added it to my wishlist. Reviewed a few forums, reviews, and seemed to only hear good things about the developer and the game. Bought it last night right before bed... should have bought it on Friday because I have to get through 3 more days of work before I can dive in fully.

Awesome game and I'm glad it is a success for you.

Ten hours on a week day sounds about like a normal work day to me. It's the weekends that make it a crunch. I wish I could spend that much time on developing games, I would have to lose a lot of sleep at the moment and in my current situation.

How did he afford being able to live while working on the game that much?

The game is great and I'm glad Barone has found success, but even if the amount of work didn't hurt him, it still strikes me as perhaps not a great sign for indie development in general.

Many people can't afford to work 70 hours a week on a personal project because they need to work full-time (or longer) in order to pay their bills. For anyone who has children, there's an even bigger time/money crunch. Is it really good for game development if, in order to be able to create a game like Stardew Valley, you basically have to be young, single, and relatively free of financial constraints?

Why do you think he is single? I don't see any mention of his status in the article.

Why do you think he is relatively free of financial constraints? I don't see any mention of that in the article either. According to the PC Gamer article, he developed the game on a very modest hand-me-down PC his father bought at Costco. I doubt he was living in poverty the whole time, but it doesn't seem like the image of wealth either.

He may not be single, but it seems quite unlikely that a 24 year old working 70 hours a week was raising children (which was my point). Maybe someone knows otherwise and can correct me.

And anyone working 70 hours a week on a personal project is almost certainly free of major financial constraints, unless he was *also* working a full-time job while developing the game, which would be insane. If you don't have to work (or don't have to work much) to pay your bills, you've got a huge leg up on people who do (which is most people).

There's a reason why nearly every celebrated indie dev is a young white guy who has no family or other obligations and an existing pool of money to draw from.

Working on indie games usually requires a lot of time, which in turn requires a lot of money, because spending that time means not having another source of income.

It's weird - there are all sorts of conventions where we talk about "inclusivity" and "diversity" and such, but these conventions cost a fair amount to attend, often don't offer child care, and are attended by the same smallish group of people. I can look at photos from indiecade, indiecade east, train jam, XOXO fest, the game loading documentary, etc - and it's not only largely homogeneous in terms of demographics, it's often literally the same people at each event. (People who seem to have a lot of free time and tremendous travel budgets) The emphasis on these in-person meetups - conventions, game jams, etc - seems to me to only further discourage people who don't have a strong financial situation and a lot of free time.

It makes me sad when I continuously read advice like "make sure you show your game at all these conventions." That's a big ask for someone who works a part time job and has kids. On top of the fact that just making a game at all is hard for a "normal" person who needs a steady source of income and has obligations.

Forgive me for the bit of a rant.

Given that time and money are two of the key resources needed, you can't really expect anyone without an ample supply of at least one of these to be on equal footing with someone who does.

Should everyone have a fair shot at developing games? Ideally,yes. But is that realistic? Not at all. This applies to pretty much anything, though, not just game development. Fortunately, however, the tools to create games keep getting better. Which is lowering the time and technical ability requirement. Eventually, it'll come down to who is just better at design, creativity, and putting it all together.

I think crunch happens when you work against your will more than it's to be expected from you as agreed by yourself or your team, or because some extrinsic factor (deadlines/lack of funds everyone?), and as consequence you start feeling burnout and that feeling doesn't go away as time goes by but somehow piles up in your mind body and feelings, and it affects other areas of your life as your relationship with family or friends, makes you quit the gym, stop eating properly or having enough sleep to stay healthy until all these lowers your productivity and happiness to alarming levels, as if you felt depressed, and it makes you hate what you've always loved most, that's making games (even that we know making games is already hard without crunch!)...

So I guess Eric could have hired someone or partly outsourced some systems (music, graphics, programming...) to prevent crunching, but he must have decided to have total control over his game to provide the deep experience he envisioned... thus when a crunch is voluntary, moreover sought for... is it really crunch?

Crunch is the wrong word. When something is simultaneously your passion, your hobby, and your planned livelihood. Then there's no "right" amount of work that should be put into it and therefore no amount that's too much to the point of "crunching." The title should just be "The 4 years of dedication and hard work that went in to Stardew Valley"

Anyway it's a great game, and certainly incredibly inspiring. Future solo developers can entirely look at ConcernedApe's efforts as something to aspire too, it certainly gave me a bit of a "yup, it can still be done" reminder.

The people saying "it's nice to have a bankroll" etc... Are totally looking at things the wrong way, excuses for why they can't rather than just doing.

Oh and the best thing about the game for sure, is that it wasn't built on a gimmick, like survival or voxel building as the more popular solo devs had in the past. It didn't have just one "killer feature" that the game was based around. It takes a well established concept and just adds content, content, content, content (while really honing in on the game play of the already established concept.)

Really the raw amount of content for a solo dev'd game is absolutely the most impressive part for sure.

Could someone explain how this game was funded? How did this guy survive financially for 4 years with no other job?

I'd like to hear that as well. Because you simply don't get to spend 70 hrs/wk on making a game for 4 years unless someone is paying for it, and that's more important than the 70 hrs really.

My guess is chucklefish helped with funding + testing for a very small cut of sales (even a .5% of sales could have covered costs of development entirely).

That's what I'd be doing as an indie publisher anyway.

I'm kind of interested too, but at the same time it's not that hard to "survive" without a job in a lot of western countries with some kind of support system, whether that be student payments, social payments, government/financial institution investment in new businesses/self employment, juggling personal credit cards (you can do this for a surprisingly long time as long as no mistakes are made.) or even, just family...

4 years is a long time, but it's not that long either, in the grand scheme of things.

Edit: I forgot to cover the obvious one, working, and then saving a fund to use for development. A lot of people waste a lot of money on holidays or cars or junk food or fashion that could be used for this.

This is exactly the question I asked. Give me 4 years of funding, and I'd gladly work 10 hours a day on my dream project.

I've read other articles that say he lived with his girlfriend and worked as a part-time theatre usher while developing the game.
http://www.vulture.com/2016/03/first-time-developer-made-stardew-v alley.html

I'm sure he has some other way of supporting himself in addition to that, but y'know, finances are personal. We can only congratulate him on making the most of the opportunities he's had and potentially making short-term sacrifices for a long-term gain.

I think Tristan is right - itÂ´s not so hard to survive if youÂ´re careful with money and get a bit of support from family or friends. The fact that he did not get any funding upfront and did it anyway also shows just how much the project inspired him to action, which I think is a crucial ingredient to make a dream project become a reality, not just keep it as a dream.

The article completely ignores the financials and other logistics of the game's development. THAT'S a central target of criticism -- not merely the possibility the developer received financial assistance. Describing how the developer supported himself is not only an important part of the conversation, but also makes for a much more compelling read. Instead, the article leaves out this crucial information and focuses on how much time and effort the developer invested. And honestly, that's not worth a lot. While I consider perseverance as an important virtue, any competent developer can create a decent game if given enough time in ideal circumstances.

The ability to deliver a great product despite the obstacles they face is what separates a great developer from a good one. That's something the article gives very little attention to.

Actually, the controls are awful. The majority of the game is melee but it still forces you to use the mouse for targeting (and you can only attack in 4 directions).
Even then if you slightly overlap the targeted tile by even one pixel your attack will only land on the next tile over.

This is even more annoying when farming and destroying the next tile over like a sprinkler or planting in the wrong spot (plants can't be moved and are destroyed when removed).

Watering too can only be done on the adjacent 8 tiles and the character frequently targets the wrong tile and also refused to water the tile under himself. Also he freezes in place when performing an action but if that action is constant attacking he actually slides forward slightly.

The combat consists of swinging wildly in a 180 degree arc killing anything that comes close.

Once you take out all of the progression padding and talking to villagers over and over (there are no dialogue options either), there is no actual gameplay underneath it all.

Just a bland game about movement and collecting, but the movement doesn't work properly.
I'm happy that the guy is doing well, but the game is just not fun to play.
It's just a grind to proceed with no gameplay (also mouse lag and no hardware mouse option which is strange for a mouse-controlled pc-only game).


Thus the game is much like the development - one big grind with stages of not working properly.
If the development was different would the gameplay have been improved?

Each to their own. You've criticised very mechanical aspects of the game. For me the amazing thing about Stardew Valley is the depth, personality, warmth and charm in the game, which is something I imagine many developers or designers would love to be able to impart on their game.

I do agree that the input handling can be a little bit frustrating at times - you do start to learn little tricks and routines to deal with it (and some game settings can help with targeting). It might not have finesse but I didn't find it stopped me from wanting to spend a long time with the game, and explore as much of it as I could.

I'm really sorry, but I'm not a developer or English native. But what is 'Post-EA Spouse world'?

It is referring to a famous open letter about crunch in Electronic Arts.
