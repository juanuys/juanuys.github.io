Setting

    What kind of world does the game take place in? Consider the time and place, what kind of society this is, and what different cultures reside there.

    Also think about the geography and geology, as well as what plants and animal life exist. What are the rules of this universe? For example, is this a place close to mundane reality, or somewhere more magical and fantastic?

World and city

We're in a megapolis called Yonderville somewhere on Planet Earthlike . The time is modern-day (or, modern enough for there to be trains, planes and automobiles).

The people of Planet Earthlike are humanoids who come in all shapes and sizes, have all different tones (skin and voice!) and self-identify on a whole spectrum of gender identities.

Society are your run-of-the-mill city dwellers and slickers, and typical of folks living in cities, they don't seem as compassionate and are mostly concerned with themselves, which is fuel for a lot of the conflict in this game!

The cultures that reside in Yonderville are fairly homogenised to be your typical city dwellers who rush from A to B in an effort to attain their one goal in life, which is usually to get ahead in the rat race of a career-focused society. This is interspersed with those smaller groups who maintain their identities as more grounded country folk, hardier Norferean folk, more laid-back Soferean folk, tricksier Wesderean folk, or calmer and wiser Esderean folk.

The geography of Yonderville is varied, with hills and rivers, plenty of wide open spaces, and lots and lots of concrete shapes everywhere which resemble buildings and skyscrapers. They don't have a word to describe their style of architecture, but a visitor might refer to it as "organic art deco".

Vegetation and plants seem mostly fleshy and fibrous like cacti, and are in bloom when the main Starlike is nearest. The animal kingdom appear to be mostly furry and smaller variations of their humanoid brethren, but with cute tails and ears and things.

Planet Earthlike is full of magical realism, and you'll have a wonderful time there.
Train stations and trains

Trains and train stations are in keeping with the organic art deco look. Like with most cities, stations are underground to closer to the centre we are, and trains run in tunnels. Trains are cramped, which is what makes them so annoying: everyone is packed in, and hot, and bothered, and got their claws out. Stations and perhaps also trains look like they were the state of the art a hundred years ago. Therefore, trains have a bit of a steampunk feel to them. They don't run smoothly, and are jerky and juddery. The fabric on the seats are dirty, and torn here and there. Since the trains run all the time, there's never a good time to patch things up.
Newsstands

Newsstands and kiosks are dotted throughout the public transport network, and this is where you can buy refreshments, chewing gum, newspapers, sweeties, wursties , and things like that.
Wursties

Wursties is a national treat, and visitors have been known to say "looks like Biltong , smells like Surströmming , damned if I put it in my mouth ". If only they can pluck up the courage! You either love it or hate it.
Faraway-so-Klouse

A small, quite village in the countryside, many miles from Yonderville. Reachable by train. This is where the final showdown takes place.
Characters

    Who are the main protagonists and antagonists in this world? Do they follow or contradict established archetypes, such as the hero, the mentor, the villain, the monster or the princess? What do the characters want that motivates them to take actions within the story? Who or what is the ‘mascot’ that features prominently in the game’s marketing?

    (We explore the visual design of these characters next week.)

Fenix (Protagonist)

The protagonist, Fenix , is a Yondervillian born-and-bred who's a bit of a push-over, has pale skin due to no amounts of time spent in the glow of the main Starlike, and slouches. They have weak, wobbly limbs and their social ineptness might be mistaken for shyness. Like most of the citizens of Yonderville, Fenix works all day to survive in this mad world, and they have to take a dreadful commute to get to their place of work.

Fenix doesn't do well with the commute, which is why they live so close to work. One journey is enough. They just can't stand up for themselves when faced with the angry and determined crowds on the trains.

Fenix vows to find Scratt and return them safely home. As such, Fenix will follow the typical zero-to-hero journey.

Fenix hates wursties, for "ethical" reasons, but we all think they just hate the smell.
Scratt (Protagonist)

Fenix owns a neko called Scratt who is Fenix's only companion. Scratt lazes about as Fenix goes out to work all day.

Scratt might fit into the gender-stereotyped "princess" role in games of old: not really lifting a finger, expecting to be served, a bit helpless and prone to being kidnapped, but very cute/beautiful indeed.

Scratt is besotted with wursties, and can't get enough of them, if only Fenix could finally buy some from the shop.
Brüli (Antagonist)

Brüli is a brutish Yondervillian bully who lives in the flat above Fenix. Brüli hates nekos. Scratt always goes up the firestairs and pops into Brüli's flat through an open window when Brüli's not there. Scratt will then help themselves to Brüli's wursties, and laze on Brüli's sofa (which is much MUCH larger than Fenix's). Scratt is a good neko and doesn't make a mess or do wee-wee in Brüli's plant pots, but Brüli being the ever-hungry wursties-pit that they are ALWAYS notices when one wurstie out of a hundred is gone, and strongly suspects "the neighbour downstairs' neko" of being the culprit.

Brüli wants revenge, and really wants Scratt gone, and/or some manner of compensation for all the missing wursties.
Other antagonists

Various "bosses" from the other parts of Yonderville and Planet Earthlike whom Fenix encounters on their mission to find Scratt.

TODO create a few bosses, time permitting. For the module demo, we might just create one protagonist: Brüli.
Shopkeeps and newsstand operators (neutral)

Various mechants that Fenix can buy stuff from, as encountered on the journey. Perhaps there'll be different types of shopkeep whom you can learn to suss out the more you encounter them, e.g. the bargain basements, the hagglers, the swindlers, etc.

TODO create a few shopkeeps and newsstand operators, but for the demo maybe only create one which can be re-used.
Kranten

Kranten wears a double-breasted suit and sports a pince nez. They are lanky and therefore always looks down on everyone through their glasses. They're always reading the newspaper. They are clean-shaven and has a long, flat upper lip. Kranten is cleverer than everyone else, and this comes across often and their snide remarks.
Plot

    What happens in the story? Does the plot follow an established structure such as the hero’s journey, or murder mystery? If so, how do the different elements of those structures translate to gameplay? What conflicts drive events forward? How can the overarching plot be broken down into smaller gameplay segments? How does the plot resolve – does the hero save the day, or is life never that simple?

The game introduces you to Fenix, who is sitting half-asleep on a train that is currently in transit underground the megapolis of Yonderville. Felix is going home after a hard day's work. Fenix is the butt-end of shoves and jabs on a very packed train, but just smiles and nods, not standing up for themselves. A very tired Fenix gets home and is greeted by an eager and loving Scratt. Fenix is re-energised. Life is good, and Fenix and Scratt are happy, and Fenix can forget their frenetic work life for a few moments more. Fenix feeds Scratt, and gives them cuddles, and we can relate to Fenix and take their side. Scratt asks Fenix (as they do every day) if they brought wursties this time, and Fenix shakes their head. Scratt looks longingly out the window. Fenix asks "you're not going upstairs again, are you?", knowing very well of Scratt's secret day-time outings.

Fenix leaves to go to work early the next morning, and Scratt ventures out as always, going upstairs via the firestairs (the fire escape on the outside of the building), and popping into the neighbour's flat through an open window. The neighbour is the brutish Brüli, and Scratt just loves Brüli's wursties.

However, this particular morning, Brüli is home. As Scratt walks into the kitchen, Brüli is standing there, turns around, and says "oh. hello?". Brüli is enamoured with Scratt's cute little face, and Scratt wants wursties. Scratt, being a neko, easily shifts their loyalties to the-holder-of-the-wursties Brüli. Brüli wants Scratt for themselves, and they "run away together".

Fenix comes home in the evening, but for the first time ever isn't greeted by a loving (and always hungry) Scratt. Fenix is overcome with panic and tries to think where Scratt may have gone. Upstairs! Of course! Fenix rushes upstairs, and knocks on Brüli's door, but there's no answer. The firestairs! Fenix goes back down, but takes the outside route up, and finds Brüli's window still open. Fenix breaks in.

Neko's tag is on the floor. Fenix walks over to the printer, and presses the "print last" button. Out comes a map, showing a destination in the countryside: Faraway-so-Klouse. Fenix looks around the flat some more, and sees a photograph of Brüli and a group of friends on the wall. Fenix takes the photo, to learn Brüli's face. (The other faces on the photo will make their appearance later.)

The journey begins. Fenix buys a train ticket, and sets off. The journey is broken up into legs, delimited by underground and overground train stations, initially in the city, and then further out. On the journeys, Fenix encounters the faces on the photographs. They've been sent by Brüli to slow Fenix down or to spy on Fenix. They divulge information about the Brüli/Scratt relationship in various ways: in jeers, maybe dropped bits of paper, or unwittingly saying things. Fenix defeats each and every one of them and gets further and further along the journey to the final destination: Faraway-so-Klouse.

(The fact that Brüli sends mates to slow Fenix down might carry more weight, as those characters will be tied to the main antagonist, and not just be randos on the train.)

Fenix gets to Faraway-so-Klouse, but Brüli and Scratt isn't at the location that one of the friends said they would be at. Fenix finds a note. "We knew you were coming, and couldn't stay to face you." (Or something to that tune). The game ends with To Be Continued...

(Since I'm not planning a sequel, this ending might be a downer. We can make it end on an upper by getting Fenix to reflect on not having a neko anymore, and it turning out to be great, actually: no more neko poop in the plant pots; no more neko scratches on all the furniture; no more neko hair clogging up everything.)

(Or, we just end the game on an upper and let the Fenix/Brüli encounter happen, after which Fenix and Scratt lives happily ever after.)
Mood

    How should the player be feeling while they play through the game and experience the story? Perhaps they should be scared, excited, awed, relaxed or amused at different points. How do you establish these moods? Is the gameplay in harmony with the story: how can you avoid ‘ludonarrative dissonance’?

The player should feel like they're rooting for Fenix, and really want the happy couple (Fenix and Scratt) to be re-united. BUT, the player should also develop a soft-spot for the Brüli/Scratt relationship which is slowly developing. Maybe especially in the final scene, the Brüli/Scratt relationship is still a bit unknown to the player, and a Big Reveal shows that they're actually quite close by the end. I suppose here the player can be given a choice to fight Brüli, or to walk away (but what would that mean?), or to just have no choice as Brüli/Scratt had disappeared again.

The player will feel more and more courageous throughout, as the game progresses, because Fenix will get stronger and stronger, and get close and closer to getting Scratt back.

The player will be thoroughly amused and entertained throughout, as I plan to inject a lot of humour, magical realism, and places and characters which are a bit out of this world.

All battles are "train battles" and the attacks etc are things one would typically do on a train, like shoving, elbow bumping, etc. To avoid ludonarrative dissonance, the final location (which isn't a train) will be empty, i.e. Brüli and Scratt will not be there. It might not make sense to have "train battles" in an empty parking lot or in a hotel room, for instance.
Narrative Structure

    At what point do we enter the story? For example, do we start from a position of stability, which is later disrupted, or do we jump straight into the action, and fill in the backstory later?

    Remember the power of mystery to keep the audience engaged. Does the game take place in one continuous flow of time, or does it jump around? Are there multiple protagonists or narrators?

We enter the story from a position of stability (Fenix and Scratt are still together). This happy co-existence is disrupted when Scratt is gone, and Fenix is in dire straits.

We could potentially start with Fenix mid-battle on a train, but the game will be humorous enough for this not to be necessary (i.e. the "depth" of the story doesn't need to be given weight with any weird narrative devices), so a linear telling will suffice. (I did consider a more systemic offering where the player has some choice over which journey branches to follow, and in effect choosing between foes or destinations, but I might as well let the player encounter foes in a linear order with a steady progression of difficulty.)

The game takes place in a continuous flow of time, and every encounter (battle) on the trains will be more severe than the previous, so the tension is forever escalating.

There is a feeling of detective/mystery throughout as Fenix squares off with Brüli's friends and they divulge bits of information about the Brüli/Scratt relationship and how Brüli/Scratt's plans might potentially change. (It's currently in the air whether these scraps of information can help the player make better decisions about which train stations to visit on their way to Faraway-so-Klouse, or which shopkeeps to avoid.)
Storytelling Techniques

    What methods are used to tell the story? For example, narration, illustrations, comic strips, cut-scenes, FMV (full motion video), dialogue, quests, audiologs, environmental storytelling and level design.

    Does the player have to do a lot of passive reading, watching or listening? What is the balance between story exposition and gameplay?

Comics

I'll use comic strips to tell any parts of the story which can't be told by the gameplay and the gameworld itself. The comic strip will seem 2D, but will have a slight tilt effect on controller movement (not as severe as the inspiration below).

comic strip inspiration

As Fenix squares off with foes on the trains, there'll be plenty of jeers, which might be audible, but potentially initially done with speech bubbles, so stick with the comic book feel.

The ratio of comics to gameplay will roughly be 1:10, i.e. for every battle scene there might be a bit of comic as a lead-up. Perhaps just one screen's worth, 3 panels max, following the pattern:

    Fenix: sitting on train, noticing one of the faces from the photograph in Brüli's flat.
    Foe: Turns head, and notices that they're being noticed. Sneers.
    Fenix: Turns back to the newspaper in their hand. Slight smile/frown.

Speech

Every character will say something, whether it be jeers during battle, or foes divulging information, or shopkeepers talking about wares. These single-shot/one-sided bits of speech will be communicated via speech bubbles, to keep with the comic feel.
Quests

Every hop on the journey is a little quest, and every encounter informs us more about the story, about Brüli's friends and who they are, about the Brüli/Scratt relationship, and so forth.
Environment

The train stations will have billboards and posters which tells you more about Yonderville and life on Planet Earthlike. The shopkeepers and newsstand operators might say a word or two about the state of things, even if just the weather.
Interactivity

    How much agency does the player have in how the story unfolds? Are they just going along for the ride, or can their decisions change the course of events? What is the relationship between the main protagonist or avatar, and the player? Is the protagonist a silent blank-slate for the player to project themselves onto, or are they a well-defined character with desires and motivations?

The player has no agency in how the story unfolds, as it will unfold in a linear way. (I think this makes for a much simpler game to develop under current constraints.)

There is no avatar (as such) that represents the player and that the player can control. The player steers the protagonist from A to B (from the safe confines of their flat, to the final show-down at Faray-so-Klouse). The player can only control Fenix's battle actions via cardplay in restricted areas (public transport). Everything else is scripted.

The player can only advance the plot from the map screen, i.e. choosing to go to the next encounter. The story follows the journey and starts at A (the protagonist's home) and ends at B (the final showdown between protagonist and antagonist). Otherwise, there is no free movement, and the plot isn't advanced with the passage of time.

Fenix is a well-defined character, with no customisations possible from the player. Fenix has well-defined desires and motivations, and the player just enabled Fenix to reach their goal.

When Fenix fails to progress through a battle scene, they end up in bed back home. The player has to start over. (This is the perma-death element from Roguelikes.) However, we might take some of the discomfort away by preserving some or all of the tricks (relics) that the player collected on the journey.
Theme

    Is there an overall theme or meaning to the game’s narrative? What is the player supposed to have learned by the end of it?

I have lived and travelled in London for over 15 years, and have grown more and more contemptuous of the London Underground. Every train is a tin of sardines. Most people are rude and entitled. It's dusty and dirty and hot. Sometimes you just feel like going postal , you know?

So, this game has 2 goals: first is the player fantasy of "lashing out a bit" on public transport, getting your way, and just one-upping the other commuters. The second goal is to teach humanity that, look, these are the various things that people do on public transport, and it's utterly annoying, so please stop doing it. Hopefully it will show people what not to do on public transport, and be kinder.

There might be a 3rd message there about lost-and-found love, or doing your absolute best to bring a friend back to your side. Or perhaps if it becomes evident that Scratt prefers Brüli, the lesson might be that if you truly love something, you have to set it free.
