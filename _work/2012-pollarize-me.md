[pollarize.me](http://app.pollarize.me) is a decision-making platform that makes it quicker and easier for you to query your friends across multiple social networks and gather their responses into one concise answer. I co-founded *pollarize* at Startup Weekend London, March 2012, which we won. Shortly after, we were accepted into Wayra UK, who gave us enough money to work on releasing *pollarize* on iOS and web in December 2012. Sadly, we have since run out of cash and have failed to secure more funding.

I worked on pollarize in my spare time whilst still at Net-A-Porter.
