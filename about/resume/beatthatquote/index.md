# My work with BeatThatQuote.com

[BeatThatQuote](http://www.beatthatquote.com/) (also trading as [Finance Leads Online](http://financeleadsonline.co.uk)) was the UK's fastest growing start-up in 2005 and won the HSBC regional award for best start-up in the London region. The companyâ€™s core business is generating and selling financial leads. As employee #5 (and the second techie!) I was resposible for implementing backends in Java, and customer self-service front-ends in RoR. BeatThatQuote has since been acquired by Google.

# Hitting the ground running

I delivered features the moment I joined. From the get-go, John Newby (my manager) and I had fun competing for lines of code, then less lines of code (because less is more), and number of tickets, delivering as many features possible in a day.

Our office was a single room, and we shared it with loads of other creative and digital teams next to Highgate Studios. Our boss, John Paleomilytes, made a pretty penny with his previous venture, JCB, which he sold to Sun for a few million. Working with an exprienced entrepreneur was a great privilege. John was very driven and very demanding, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I like a founder with a clear vision.

# Growth

The business grew, We recruited, and the team grew. My responsibilities increased, and I was tasked with implementing the direct-to-broker whitelable leads acquisition system in RoR. We also wrote one of the first ever Ajax code (not iFrame + src attribute, but XmlHttpRequest). This was a year before the first jQuery release.

I also grew immensely as a developer whilst working for BeatThatQuote.com. The pace was fast, and the tasks demanding. John would stand behind me, waiting for a bit of Ruby to deploy, saying "Every minute is X thousand pounds" and my heart would start pounding, and my hands would shake a little. But, I loved every minute of it. Never in your life would you so quickly learn to implement keyboard shortcuts for everything, and never ever even look at your keyboard ever again.
