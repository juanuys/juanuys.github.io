# My work with  [Mobilize Systems](http://www.mobilize-systems.com/) (previously The Light Agency)

The Light Agency was spearheaded by [Marc Lewis](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=4761107) &mdash; a tour de force of creation. I remember being in the interview when Marc came into the boardroom on his Segway, with his signature pyjama bottoms. I saw Marc again later when he was a Wayra mentor (when I did pollarize.me). I was an absolute honour to have Marc as our visionary leader. He's a great guy, and you'd be privileged to meet him some time.

My immediate manager, [Jason Griffin](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jason-griffin/2/150/a52), was ex-BBC, and a stickler for quality. I learnt a lot from Jason (I almost wrote JSON). If I've learnt anything from Jason, it would be to deliver the absolute perfect yet simple piece of software you can concieve, in the shortest amount of time. No minimim viable product &mdash; just maximum perfection, like yesterday.
