## Introduction

I'm a [London-based](http://pits-to-palace.tumblr.com/) South African who has been doing tech work since 2002. I've designed, architected and implemented entire social networks and ecommerce systems, while also assuming the role of developer, ops, analyst and tester throughout (a given for single technical co-founders).

Most information about said activity can be found on my [personal](http://opyate.com) and [professional](http://uys.io) websites, or my [StackOverflow careers profile](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/opyate).

## Conde Nast Commerce (as [Unleash Your Server](http://www.uys.io))

Helping [style.com](http://style.com) build their new ecommerce website.

## pdfcrun.ch (as [Unleash Your Server](http://www.uys.io))

Latterly, I started a new business called <a href="https://pdfcrun.ch">pdfcrunch</a>. It turns PDFs into data. It's been quite computer vision -heavy, and I've been spending a lot of time in iPython notebooks tweaking algorithms.

The tech stack comprises Python (with scikit/numpy/etc for the CV stuff, and Tornado/Flask/Pika for the API glue), Scala and Clojure (to interface with some existing Java-based PDF tools), Docker (running a cluster on EC2 using tutum.co), PostgresQL, RabbitMQ (to de-couple the many different types of background workers), with AngularJS on the frontend (for editing stencils). 

## Unleash Your Server

[Unleash Your Server](http://www.uys.io) is my company.

From server to app in 60 (to the power of 3.7 &#8432;) seconds.

<em>*</em> custom development, estimate for typical consumer app. One day we will auto-generate these things.

Over the years I've amassed and honed a bunch of skills that empowers me to take one or many bare-bones servers (e.g. EC2/app-cell/dyno) and turn it into an application comprised many moving parts and components, including messages queues, databases, web servers, caches, web APIs, responsive and easy-to-use frontends, and mobile clients &mdash; all backed by an agile development process and other pragmatic best practices, including full configuration management, continuous integration, source control, and a whole host of other things I consider obvious and take for granted. Full-stack developer? Maybe!

I've always wanted to form a collective of capable and varied individuals to build beautiful things with me, because I believe teams are better than individuals. I have, however, failed to do so twice now, mostly due to shifting interests, or loosing team members to itches they just have to scratch.

Unleash Your Server is a new endeavour, but I've started this one on my own. The name is a play on my surname, UYS, chosen by my mate and old business partner [@wehtam](http://twitter.com/wehtam) (yes, I suck at naming things, and besides &mdash; it's one of the two biggest problems in computer science, alongside cache invalidation, and off-by-one errors).

Apart from finding new problems to solve and organically building businesses around them, I've had the immense privilege of starting my new journey with GOV.UK on the [transformation](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/01/29/200-days-of-transformation-200-days-to-go/) project.

## Freelance

2 weeks is not enough paternity leave for any new father, so I embarked on a 10 month adventure as a WFH dad / freelancer.

I mostly worked with start-ups from my network, and work included credit scoring, news generation by way of AI, a service marketplace, and solving the age-old British problem of the queue.

## [pollarize.me](http://app.pollarize.me)

*Pollarize* is a decision-making platform that makes it quicker and easier for you to query your friends across multiple social networks and gather their responses into one concise answer. I co-founded *pollarize* at Startup Weekend London, March 2012, which we won. Shortly after, we were accepted into Wayra UK, who gave us enough money to work on releasing *pollarize* on iOS and web in December 2012. Sadly, we have since run out of cash and have failed to secure more funding.

## [Net-A-Porter.com](http://www.net-a-porter.com/)

I worked at Net-A-Porter.com for almost 7 years, and some of my achievements include implementing our first shared payment service, our first API and our first translations system. I have led teams, and I've also won a hack day with an iOS app.

## [BeatThatQuote.com](http://www.beatthatquote.com) 


[BeatThatQuote.com](http://www.beatthatquote.com/) (also trading as [Finance Leads Online](http://financeleadsonline.co.uk)) was the UK's fastest growing start-up in 2005 and won the HSBC regional award for best start-up in the London region. The company’s core business is generating and selling financial leads. As employee #5 (and the second techie!) I was resposible for implementing backends in Java, and customer self-service front-ends in RoR. BeatThatQuote has since been acquired by Google.

## Ye olden days

A large part of my career is too long ago to be technically relevant, so the takeaway for me is the experience, soft skills, and architectural knowledge.

Read more about the dinosaur days of my career [here](/about/resume/dinosaur/).

## Extracurricular

* I do some speaking on APIs at [The Mobile Academy](http://themobileacademy.org.uk/whos-who/juan-uys/)
* You'll sometimes see me at the Scala, Ruby and various other meetup groups.

## Learning

I'm not a big fan of dust, rust and cobwebs of the mind. Here goes:

[Diploma in Scientific Computing](http://issc.uj.ac.za/issc/scschool.html), [electronic engineering drop-out](http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/engineering/departments/eeesci/Pages/default.aspx) (long story!), Sun Certified Java Programmer, [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun), [Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis), [Web Intelligence and Big Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/bigdata), [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs271) and I'm also a qualified advanced scuba diver.

## Doodling

I've recently taken up doodling, and like most people who dive into a new hobby, you initially think you're quite good (Dunning–Kruger!) and that's when you get picture book ideas and comic book ideas and think you can publish something one day. I'm now past that stage and think I suck quite a bit, but it's fun nonetheless and it might cheer someone up to see them.
