Here's what I'm doing right [now](https://nownownow.com/about)...

# 2023-02-22

The new home office is completed. Thread [here](https://mastodon.art/@uys/109522808559217269).

For my [game](/games/melt), I spend most of the last month stealing re-usable code from prototypes, archiving useless docs, cleaning up the mood board, tidying the design doc, cleaning up Trello, and finally have a nice action plan to start the Production phase. (Although, there might be another 2 sneaky prototypes due for some tiny new ideas I had. There's no escaping the ideas!)

Next week, I'm starting a new client engagement as well, with [Cytora](https://cytora.com/), where we'll be digitising risk with the help of AI/ML.

I'm reading [The Incal](https://jodoverse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Incal).

Right [now](https://nownownow.com/about), I'm working with the machine learning team at all.health, on content verification (the stuff our AI doc says) and patient simulation.

Gamedev is somewhat on hold, as the new garden office will only be built in January.

I've just finished a re-read of [China Mi√©ville's The Scar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scar_%28novel%29), and started on [Nic Bostrom's Superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies).
