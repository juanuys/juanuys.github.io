Look at your mother. Look at your best friend. Look at the young couple walking down the street. Then look at yourself.

What do we all need?

Let me give you a hint: Maslow.

So, presumably you're warm and fed, by virtue of reading this on a device. That's the first level covered.

That brings us to level 2.

Safety.

How can each and every human being on this planet be safe?

We've done a pretty good job of erecting structures with which to protect ourselves. We've done a pretty good job of putting wild animals in parks and cages. We're still learning how to deal with strong winds and big oceanic waves.

The one thing we haven't dealt with yet is ourselves.

And here we get to the crux: you won't be able to change someone else. You can only change yourself.

And it's pretty easy if you stick to this one, tiny motto:

**Do no harm.**

The rest just falls in place.

Was your father a racist bigot who kept spitting hate into your ears as you grew up? Do no harm, and this disease won't propogate.

Were you robbed, the insurance didn't pay out, and the only way to rectify your debt is to take a bit from your wealthy boss? Do no harm, because nature restores the balance. Naturally.
