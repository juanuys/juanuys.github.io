Remember: don't just describe the context/experience. Analysis and evaluation (of an experience) is important.
Also, don't just focus on a single domain of reflection (see below).

# Domains of reflection

Tag the post with one or more of the below tags depending on the content.


## dispositional -> crj-dispositional

time management, motivation, general behaviour, discipline, etc.
(This is supposed to be a "solved" problem. Find more resources about solving this problem online, tutors)

## affective -> crj-affective

all aspects of how you deal with feelings, experiences and emotions.
emotional intelligence.
key skills: emotional awareness, self-assessment.

## interpersonal -> crj-interpersonal

Effectively working with others, and all the skills involved:
- verbal/non-verbal comms
- listening
- negotiation
- problem solving
- decision-making
- assertiveness

## cognitive -> crj-cognitive

assess strengths and weaknesses in your approach to learning.
Identify trajectories of learning that will compliment your ambitions and career paths.

## procedural -> crj-procedural

All about identifying skills you already have, and identifying where improvements are needed.
(failure is an important component of learning)

# Assignment

https://flex.falmouth.ac.uk/courses/872/assignments/2387

# From the course website:

By devising a series of small-scale creative artefacts, you will use your existing ideas about development practice and then experiment with new approaches to challenge these ideas. This will enable you to create a personal case study, from which you can define how to expand and enrich your practice. Beyond the personal case study, you will gain a broader sense of the contexts in which these practices are applied across disciplines. 

# From every week's reflective writing assignment page:

Reflection is an essential study skill, enabling you to pause and pull everything together, contextualise what you learned, and identify any issues and doubts so you can address them.

Every week, when you have completed the materials and activities, please write a critical reflection entry in your journal, covering (but not limited to) the following points:

- Discussion of your understanding of the theories and concepts, based on the materials, activities and readings, with appropriate references.
- What you learned in the challenge activities and from your peers, and if your thoughts have changed since.
- Any obstacles you encountered and how you overcame (or are overcoming) them.

You may also include graphics and other media.

# And

Your journal is a place for you to:

- Practise writing in analytical and evaluative styles rather than a descriptive style;
- Analyse the concepts you develop through your ongoing deliberate practice;
- Examine how you've applied your research and directed learning to you practice-based projects;
- Look backward to see what you have accomplished so far;
- Project forward to desirable goals you might obtain in the future.

# From the studyhub on 'reflective writing'

https://studyhubresources.fxplus.ac.uk/written-assignments/reflective-writing

## Section 1

Reflective writing is evidence of reflective thinking. At university, reflective thinking usually involves:

- Looking back at something (often an event, i.e. something that happened, but it could also be an idea or object).
- Analysing the event or idea (thinking in depth and from different perspectives, and trying to explain, often with reference to a model or theory from your subject).
- Thinking carefully about what the event or idea means for you and your ongoing progress as a learner.

## Section 3

Basic reflective writing can be broken down into three parts: description, interpretation and outcome.

## 3a Description

- What happened?
- What is being examined?

E.g.

> Specific tasks were shared out amongst members of my team. Initially, however, the tasks were not seen as equally difficult by all team members

## 3b Interpretation

- What is most important / interesting / useful / relevant about the object, event or idea?
- How can it be explained e.g. with theory?
- How is it similar to and different from others?

> Cooperation between group members was at risk because of this perception of unfairness. Social interdependence theory recognises a type of group interaction called ‘positive interdependence’, meaning cooperation (Johnson & Johnson, 1993, cited by Maughan & Webb, 2001), and many studies have demonstrated that 'cooperative learning experiences encourage higher achievement' (Maughan & Webb, 2001).


## 3c - Outcome

- What have I learned from this?
- What does this mean for my future?

> Ultimately, our group achieved a successful outcome, but to improve our achievement, we perhaps needed a leader to help encourage cooperation when tasks were being shared out. In future group work, I would probably suggest this.

## 4 General principles

This is just one way of structuring reflective writing. There are others - whatever structure you use, remember:

- Reflection is an *exploration and an explanation of events* – not just a description of them.
- Genuinely reflective writing often involves ‘revealing’ *anxieties, errors and weaknesses, as well as strengths and successes*. You should show some understanding of possible causes, and explain how you plan to move on.
- You should *select just the most significant parts* of the event or idea on which you’re reflecting. Don't try to ‘tell the whole story'.
- It is useful to ‘think ahead' to the future as well as ‘reflecting back’ on the past.

# From week 1's topics, 'reflective journal entry'

https://flex.falmouth.ac.uk/courses/872/pages/week-1-reflective-journal-entry?module_item_id=44792

Every week, when you have completed the materials and activities, please write a critical reflection entry in your journal, covering (but not limited to) the following points:

- Discussion of your understanding of the theories and concepts, based on the materials, activities and readings, with appropriate references.
- What you learned in the challenge activities and from your peers, and if your thoughts have changed since.
- Any obstacles you encountered and how you overcame (or are overcoming) them.

# Rubric (from the assignment for the module)

https://flex.falmouth.ac.uk/courses/872/assignments/2387

## depth of insight

Depth of insight examines your ability to synthesise your directed learning, self-directed research, and tutor/peer feedback to inform and explore your practice. This criterion shows that you are receptive to criticism and actively looking for ways to enhance your practice.

## self-criticism

Self-criticism examines the presence of challenges and obstacles in your reflections as well as how they relate to your stated career goals. Notably, each should be accompanied by an analysis of how and why the problem arose, ideally in relation to a specific form of practice or a project, and insight into what to do next to overcome it.

## breadth of analysis

Breath of analysis examines two elements. Firstly, how holistic your reflections are and whether they span the key domains associated with your practice. Secondly, whether all important key skills associated with your practice have been addressed.

## plan for future research and practice

Plan for future research and practice examines, firstly, your ability to suggest relevant items of academic literature, grey literature, and industrial case-studies that could be used to support your practice, as well as your ability to present a plan that conforms to [SMART principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria): specific; measurable; achievable; relevant; and time-bound.

## structure and reflective style

Structure and reflective style examine the way that you handle the reflection in terms of aesthetics and tone. Reflective writing is less formal than academic writing. However, you still need to maintain Harvard Referencing throughout. Structure focuses on the layout and flow or the work whereas style is more about the way things are communicated in terms of language and tone.
