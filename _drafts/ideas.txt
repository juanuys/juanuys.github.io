# Foregoing shiny toys

First and foremost, as always when starting a new game, I'm reminded of all the great tools and technologies out there, and I would love to try them all. For instance, Houdini VFX, where effects are typically designed to react to actions taking place in a shot and a procedural solution “automates” these reactions {% cite noauthor_houdini_nodate %}.

But I know what I can do, and I want to continue only doing that, but better, and only really focus on becoming a better game designer. Play to your strengths, and all that.
