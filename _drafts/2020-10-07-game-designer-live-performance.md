I read [this post](https://galyonk.in/the-indie-games-are-too-damn-cheap-11b8652fad16) by Sergiy Galyonkin, the founder of [Steam Spy](https://steamspy.com/).

> You can find indies in any other big entertainment market: movies, comics, music. Everywhere else small creators face the same problem: making the ends meet with a relatively small audience.

Kevin Kelly talks about this too, and states that you can [make a living if you have 1,000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/).

Indie musicians nowadays make money by playing lots of live performances. Gone are the days of making lots of money with record sales. Songs are free, and shows are paid-for.

<span class="highlight">Could this be an avenue for indie game designers? Live performances?</span>

How could this work?

You set a date in the calendar. All your fans get together at the same time, in the game. However, for the next hour, the game will be different: it won't have the same levels, the same NPCs, the same goals. For the next hour, the game designer (the host) will "live perform" the game, and inject props, sounds, goals, etc while the other gamers are playing.

How would the game designer do this?

Well, this is a great question.

Falls Guys "live", where the Host puts obstacles in front of the runners in real time
some capture-the-flag game where blue=gamers and red=host, and only red has a flag, and it's on the other side of the map. Again, the host introduces obstacles, e.g. a great ravine (gamers need to build a bridge or climb), or a great wall (gamers now need to scale it), etc
The obstacles could be new content, and if you (gamer) participated in the event, you now have exclusive access to the new content.
