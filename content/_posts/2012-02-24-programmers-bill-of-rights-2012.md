It’s time to collate the various programmers’ bills of rights on the Interwebs and update it for the current age. <a href="#¹">¹</a>

Cross-posted from [http://perks.opyate.com](http://perks.opyate.com).

Inspired by [Jeff Atwood’s post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/08/the-programmers-bill-of-rights.html), and my own needs as a programmer.

# The Necessities

The right tools and supplies for your brew.

I get my beans from [Monmouth in Camden](http://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/). I’m a won’t-roast-but-will-grind my own beans kinda guy. And then it’s also worth filling the kettle from a Britta jug.

# The Hardware

All programmers want and need a MacBook Air.

Why? Because they’re light, beautiful, snappy, It Just Works ™ and besides, if you’re making a case for less hours in the office, what better way to take your work everywhere you go?

Pixel real estate. Yes, a nice, extra 27 inches will do.

(OK, so personally I don’t need an extra monitor. I use my 13” Air in the pub, on the train, at the coffee shop, on the sofa. I work the same way everywhere I go, so plugging in an extra monitor in the office just doesn’t feel right.)

A large SSD.

Obvious speed benefits aside, the large capacity means you can take with you all your VMs, your hundreds of Github checkouts, play environments (like [Supercollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/), [Pd](http://puredata.info/), [R](http://www.r-project.org/), [Squeak VM](http://squeak.org/), [Oz VM](http://www.mozart-oz.org/), etc), eBooks, large data sets (for those [Big Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) geeks), and just about everything you can learn from.

Speedy Internet connection.

And, please don’t put your super fast fibre optic line behind a crappy wifi router. (yes, wifi is a must, so we can go and chill out on the sofa if we need to.)

Why? Because everything is on the Internet already. [Solutions](http://stackexchange.com/), [advice](http://www.quora.com/), [stuff to read](http://news.ycombinator.com/), [opinions](http://pollarize.me/), [cat videos](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stalking+cat) for the in-between moments, and The Wheel, which we won’t (and shouldn’t) have to reinvent.

# The Privileges

An engineer SHALL have admin rights to her/his computer <a href="#²">²</a>

OK, so I know all about [PCI compliancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard) and the weight of the phrase “your CEO will go to jail if you don’t harden system X”. Still, any devops worth their salt will put their developers on a secure dev subnet where they can’t make mistakes or pose any threats.

Hack days. [Google does it](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/jobs/21pre.html). [Atlassian does it](http://www.atlassian.com/company/about/shipit). [Everyone](http://blog.twitter.com/2012/01/hack-week-twitter.html) [does](http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2012/feb/03/guardian-hack-day-2) [it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUwEEOhcK3s), and so should you. The [benefits](http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/hack-days-not-just-for-facebookers.html) have been [espoused](http://globalpersonals.co.uk/blog/hack-attack/) time and time again.

[Plan](http://hackdaymanifesto.com/) well, and have fun, and ensure that the hack lives on: as much fun as hack days are, developers get gratification from seeing their time investment go beyond the awards ceremony.

# The Chair

An ergonomic chair that will last forever.

I’ve sat in one of these for 3 years now (not continuously, mind) and my back loves me for it. It’s cool in summer, reclines with grace, and makes you feel like your sitting on a cloud while managing your apps in the Cloud.

Get one.

# ...and so forth

This is by no means an exhaustive list, and I'll be happy to hear what other programmers consider the bear necessities.

<a name="¹">¹</a> This is obviously tongue-in-cheek, and programmers make no demands ;-)

<a name="²">²</a> …and all the required ports will be open.
