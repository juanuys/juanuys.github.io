Contumacious Commuter started in 2016 as a mobile game made with Unity. The (incomplete) <abbr title="game design document">[GDD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dh53Hb-zmO5dx76a-vuSD-BnMGA7PRjBw5pul5Q54vM/edit?usp=sharing)</abbr> talks about the art style, which is something I was quite excited about illustrating and animating: using [SquiggleVision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squigglevision) characters, perhaps super-imposed over real train interiors (and other forms of public transport).

Unfortunately, the hex library I was using at the time had a new version come out which had a completely different API. I was stuck and the developers dragged their feet supporting me on the old version, continuously urging me to get the new version. I don't mind paying for tools, but I was going to have to rewrite a bunch of stuff, so things fell by the wayside.

The idea lives on as a card game, though. But that is sadly also a work in progress... Meanwhile, I'm playing as many card games as I can, and learning how to design a good card game.

Behold, placeholder graphics and one SquiggleVision character:
