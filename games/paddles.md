A remake of one of [Kenta Cho's games](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/), remade with ðŸ§¡

I also put it on Steam as a free game, with more mini games to come.

The Steam game is called "All About The High Score", and the first mini game is called "Jumpdot", instead of the slightly longer "Paddles, paddles everywhere! An ode to Cho."
