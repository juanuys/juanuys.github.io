Behold, my 2021 [7DRL](https://7drl.com/) entry.

My mate [Tim](https://twitter.com/timruffles) suggested we attend 7DRL. I saw [Laser Cup](https://twitter.com/LaserCupGame/status/1359531889606950921) just a few days before, and fancied the idea of a footballer stuck in a dungeon. I liked the idea of incorporating a continuous game mechanic (football) in the usually turn-based Roguelike setting.

Have fun!
