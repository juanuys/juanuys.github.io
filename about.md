Hi, I'm Juan <span style="color: gray;">(pronounced like the French *Jean*)</span> and I live in North London.

I [help companies](https://uys.io/cv/) with web technologies by day, and get up to all sorts of mischief by night, like [making stuff](https://uys.io/portfolio/), [drawing pictures](/doodles/), and writing short stories whilst dabbing my teary eyes with my wonderful collection of rejection letters.

That said, I love to collaborate on creative technical work. Please reach out at [opyate@gmail.com](mailto:opyate@gmail.com?subject=collaboration).

PS I also have an [online attic](https://opyate.com/). At your own peril, and all that.
