Hi, I'm Juan <span style="color: gray;">(pronounced like the French *Jean*)</span> and I live in North London.

I [help companies](https://uys.io/cv/) with web technologies by day, and get up to all sorts of mischief by night, like [making stuff](https://uys.io/portfolio/), [drawing pictures](/doodles/), and writing short stories whilst dabbing my teary eyes with my wonderful collection of rejection letters.

That said, I love to collaborate on creative technical work. Please reach out at [opyate@gmail.com](mailto:opyate@gmail.com?subject=collaboration).

This website uses a sprinkling of vanilla Javascript on pages that need it, but otherwise won't track you.

Get notified via [RSS](/feed.xml) or elsewhere (see below) whenever this butterfly flaps his tiny wings.

Lastly, try a good [quote](/quotes).

Very lastly, more history at the very bottom of this page as a bonus for reading this far. Because you CLEARLY want to know more.

## Quick chronology

- born in the seventies
- the 80s is a blur of playing LEGO, watching "Karate films" on VHS, and playing way too much Contra
- start programming in early nineties
- experience mid-life crises in late nineties, write an exegesis on the world, but sell the computer it's on

Yes, it was a tricky time. In fact, I looked a bit like an African David Foster Wallace back then.
Let's continue...

- briefly join a few bands and make "interesting" alternative music whilst burning through a small lump sum
- hop over to Europe from Africa in the early 2000s with a view expand mind
- said mind increasingly runs in circles thinking of different things, like a terrible polyglot
- meet significant other around 2010s and finally feel like someone's got my back
- the continuance of purpose is side-tracked by the arrival of offspring
- here we are now
