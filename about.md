Hi, I'm Juan (pronounced like the French *Jean*).

I'm a [coder](https://uys.io/cv/), [illustrator](/doodles/) and writer from North London.

When I'm not dabbing at my teary eyes using my pile of rejection letters, I like to see my hobbies come together in the form of computer games or art installations.

That said, I love to collaborate on creative technical work. If you like what you see [here](/made/) and maybe [here](https://uys.io/portfolio/), please reach out at [opyate@gmail.com](mailto:opyate@gmail.com?subject=collaboration).

PS I also have an [online attic](https://opyate.com/). At your own peril, and all that.
