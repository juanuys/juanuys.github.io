# Quick chronology

- born in the seventies in Africa
- the 80s is a blur of playing LEGO, watching "Karate films" on VHS, and playing way too much Contra
- start programming in early nineties
- experience mid-life crises in late nineties, write an exegesis on the world, but sell the computer it's on

Yes, it was a tricky time. In fact, I looked a bit like an African David Foster Wallace back then.
Let's continue...

- briefly join a few bands and make "interesting" alternative music whilst burning through a small lump sum
- hop over to Europe from Africa in the early 2000s with a view expand mind
- said mind increasingly runs in circles thinking of different things, like a terrible polyglot
- meet significant other around 2010s and finally feel like someone's got my back
- the continuance of purpose is momentarily side-tracked by the arrival of offspring
- said offspring becomes more autonomous, so I start a masters in gamedev
- here we are now
