love problem 2
get team members something to fall in love with.
We gave Oli the fun bits: coming up with story, or coming up with SFX to use in the audio.
The real work is actually writing the prose, or the audio engineer having to mix/master the audio (that someone else chose)

Show the tweet I made for Josh:
- me coming up with story
VS
- me having to write 40K words to finish the story

folks being in love with a different idea of what the game would be like.
That's why I made it clear in the very beginning what the game is going to be.

Game design and development are hard. Unless you are multitalented and your project is tiny, you can't do it alone. People are more important than ideas, because, in the words of Pixar's Ed Catmull, "If you give a good idea to a mediocre group, they'll screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a good group, they'll fix it."

game filtered through a large number of people would be anything other than bland. As it turned out, the opposite was true; the people involved were tired of working in isolation and were energized by the collaborative process, and the resulting designs had a consistent level of polish and depth that hadn’t been seen before.

People with strong personalities, people with poor verbal skills, or people who just don’t like creating in a group setting shouldn’t be forced into it. We weighted our groups heavily toward people with a lot of group design experience, well ahead of game design experience.
